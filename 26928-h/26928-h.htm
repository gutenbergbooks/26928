</div>

<p>It may be urged that all proper heroines go
through a period of uncertainty before giving
their hands and hearts in marriage. Occasionally,
however, there are longer seasons
of indecision, incident to pride, high temper,
or misunderstanding on the lady&#8217;s side, or
to poverty, undue timidity, or lack of high
pressure on the part of the gentleman. I
have christened the heroines of this volume
&#8220;Ladies-in-Waiting,&#8221; and that no mental
picture may be formed of Queen and Court
and Maids of Honor I have asked the artist
to portray for the frontispiece a marriageable
maiden seated pensively upon a hillside.
Her attitude is plainly one of suspended
animation while the new moon above her
shoulders suggests to the reader that she
will not wait in vain.</p>

<h2>MISS THOMASINA TUCKER</h2>
</div>

<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.4em;'>I</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Miss Tucker!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck, Miss Tommy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bye, bye, Tomsie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stay away too long!&#8221;</p>
<p>These sentiments were being called from
the Hoboken dock to the deck of an ocean
steamer, while a young lady, buried in bouquets
and bonbons, leaned over the rail,
sparkling, inciting, compelling, responding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care of yourself, Tommy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see but that I must! Nobody else
to do it!&#8221; she responded saucily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t let &#8217;em if they tried!&#8221;
This from a rosy-cheeked youngster who
was as close to the water&#8217;s edge as safety permitted.
&#8220;Say, did you guess what my floral
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
offering was to be when you trimmed your
hat? I <i>am</i> flattered!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry! The hat was trimmed weeks ago,
and I&#8217;m wearing your bouquet because it
matches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, awfully,&#8221; replied the crestfallen
youth. &#8220;Plans for reduction of head-size
constantly on file in Miss Tucker&#8217;s office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just Carl&#8217;s luck to hit on a match.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see any particular luck in being
accessory to a hat trimming,&#8221; grumbled
Carl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Write now and then, Miss Tommy, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221; said a fellow with eyeglasses and an
air of fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t promise! I&#8217;ll wait till I&#8217;m rich
enough to cable!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shilling a word&#8217;s expensive, but you can
send &#8217;em to me collect. My word is &#8216;Hopeful,&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;at
which the little party laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Register another, and make it &#8216;Uncertain,&#8217;&#8221;
called the girl roguishly, seeing that
no one was paying any attention to her
friends and their nonsense.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></p>
<p>&#8220;London first, is it?&#8221; asked the rosy youth.
&#8220;Decided on your hotel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hotel? It&#8217;s going to be my share of a
modest Bloomsbury lodging,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;Got to sing my way from a third-floor-back
in a side street to a gorgeous suite at the
Ritz!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll watch you!&#8221; cried three in chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;d rather hear you, darling,&#8221; said
a nice, tailor-made girl, whose puffy eyelids
looked as if she had been crying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessed lamb! I hope I&#8217;ll be better worth
hearing! Oh, do go home, all of you; especially
you, Jessie! My courage is oozing out
at the heels of my shoes. Disappear! I&#8217;ve
been farewelling actively for an hour and
casually for a week. If they don&#8217;t take off
the gangplank in a minute or two I shan&#8217;t
have pluck enough to stick to the ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t expect us to brace you up,
Tommy,&#8221; said the rosy youth. &#8220;We&#8217;re losing
too much by it. Come along back! What&#8217;s
the matter with America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to her that way, Carl,&#8221;&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
the tailor-made girl looked at him reproachfully.
&#8220;You know she&#8217;s got nobody
and nothing to come back to. She&#8217;s given
up her room. She&#8217;s quarreled with her beastly
uncle at last; all her belongings are in the hold
of the steamer, and she&#8217;s made up her mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All ashore that&#8217;s going ashore!&#8221; The
clarion tones of the steward rang through the
air for the third time, and the loud beating
of the ship&#8217;s gong showed that the last moment
had come. The gangplank was removed
and the great liner pushed off and slowly
wended her way down-river, some of the
more faithful ones in the crowd waving handkerchiefs
until she was a blur in the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no truer way of showing
loyalty than by going to Hoboken to see a
friend off,&#8221; said the eyeglassed chap as he
walked beside Jessie Macleod to the ferry.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do it for anybody but Tommy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I!&#8221; exclaimed the rosy youth.
&#8220;Good old Tommy! I wonder whether she&#8217;ll
sing and have a career, or fall in love over
there?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She might do both, I should think; at
least it has been done, though not, perhaps,
with conspicuous success,&#8221; was Carl&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever she does, we&#8217;ve lost her,&#8221;
sighed the girl; &#8220;and our little set will be so
dull without Tommy!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Fergus Appleton had leaned over the deck
rail for a few moments before the ship started
on her voyage; leaned there idly and indifferently,
as he did most things, smoking his
cigarette with an air of complete detachment
from the world. He was going to no one,
and leaving no one behind. He had money
enough to live on, but life had always been
something of a bore to him and he could not
have endured it without regular occupation.
His occasional essays on subjects connected
with architecture, his critical articles in similar
fields, his travels in search of wider information,
the book on which he was working
at the moment,&mdash;these kept him busy
and gave him a sense of being tolerably useful
in his generation. The particular group
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
of juveniles shouting more or less intimate
remarks to a girl passenger on board the
steamer attracted his attention for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are very young,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;or
they would realize that they are all revealing
themselves with considerable frankness, although
nobody seems to be listening but me!&#8221;</p>
<p>He would not have listened, as a matter
of fact, had it not been for the voice of the
girl they called Tommy. It was not loud, but
it had the quality of a golden bell, and Fergus
was susceptible to a beautiful voice. One
other thing&mdash;the slightest possible thing&mdash;enlisted
his notice. She wore a great bunch
of mignonette stuck in the waistband of her
green cloth dress, and her small hat had a
flat wreath of the same flower. Mignonette
was, perhaps, the only growing thing of
which Fergus Appleton ever took note, and
its perfume was the only one that particularly
appealed to his rather dull sense of smell;
the reason being that in the old garden of
the house in which he was born there was
always a huge straggling patch of mignonette.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
His mother used to sit there on summer
mornings and read to him, and when he
lay on his back in the sunshine he used to
watch the butterflies and humming-birds
and trees, and sniff the fragrance that filled
the air. When his mother died, he wandered
into the garden, sought the familiar corner,
and flung himself on the bed of mignonette
to cry his heart out&mdash;the lonely heart of an
eight-year-old boy. That was five and twenty
years ago, but he never passed a florist&#8217;s
open door in summer-time without remembering
that despairing hour and the fragrance
of the flowers, bruised with his weight and
moist with his tears.</p>
<p>The girl vanished the moment the steamer
was out of sight of the dock, and Fergus did
not give her another thought for a day or two.
He had liked her green cloth dress and the
hat that framed her young, laughing, plucky
face. He had thought her name suited her,
and wondered what dignified appellation
had been edited, cut, and metamorphosed
to make &#8220;Tommy,&#8221; deciding after a look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
at the passenger list that it was Thomasina,
and that the girl must be Miss Thomasina
Tucker, an alliterative combination which
did not appeal to his literary taste.</p>
<p>The voyage was a rough one, and he saw
her only now and then, always alone, and
generally standing on the end of the ship, her
green cape blowing in a gale of wind and
showing a scarlet lining, her mignonette hat
exchanged for a soft green thing with an upstanding
scarlet quill. She was the only companionable
person on board, but he did not
know her and sat nowhere near her at table,
an assemblage of facts that seemed to settle
the matter, considering the sort of man he
was and the sort of girl she was.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s too pretty and too young to be
gallivanting about &#8216;on her own,&#8217;&#8221; he said
to himself one morning, when Tommy stood
on the upper deck looking out to sea and, as
far as he could judge, singing, though there
was such a gale blowing that he could not
hear her voice. &#8220;But all the girls are the same
nowadays,&#8221;&mdash;and he puffed his pipe disconsolately;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
&#8220;all the same; brisk, self-supporting,
good fellows. If I ever met a nice,
unsuccessful-but-not-depressed sort of girl,
soft but not silly, mild but not tame, flexible
but not docile, spirited but not domineering,
I think I should capitulate; but they&#8217;re all
dead. The type has changed, and I haven&#8217;t
changed with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Fergus Appleton did not make acquaintances
easily; no man does who has had a
lonely, neglected boyhood, his only companion
a father who seldom remembered his
existence, and, when he did, apparently regretted
it. He had known girls, but he was a
shy, silent, ugly boy, and appealed as little
to them as they to him. He did not live
through the twenties without discovering
that a fine crop of sentiment was growing in
his heart; he also discovered that he didn&#8217;t
know in the least what to do with it. George
Meredith, speaking of Romance, says: &#8220;The
young who avoid that region escape the title
of Fool at the cost of a Celestial crown.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Fergus Appleton wouldn&#8217;t have minded being
called a fool if only he could have contrived
to deserve the title, and the glimmer
of the crown celestial had been in his imagination
more than once until he turned thirty
and decided it was not for his head. Guileless
school-girls did not appeal to him, and
elderly sirens certainly had no power to
charm; he was even widow-proof, so he became
a thoroughfare for sisterly affection.
Girls suffocated him with friendliness, which
was not the stuff of which his dreams were
made.</p>
<p>However, he had nothing to complain of,
for he got as good as he gave, and it occurred
to him that he could not expect to
start a disastrous conflagration in any maiden
bosom so long as he had no brimstone, nor
any substitute for it, on his own premises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; he reflected (though perhaps
not oftener than once a year), &#8220;if I
haven&#8217;t a tie in the world, I have complete
freedom to do as I like!&#8221; And if the said
freedom palled upon him occasionally, nobody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
was the wiser, for Fergus Appleton did
not wear his heart on his sleeve.</p>
<p>As for Tommy, there had been several
Thomas Tuckers in genealogical line, and
the father of Thomasina was already Thomas
Tucker the third. Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, the
parents of the first Thomas, must have been
somewhat lacking in humor, and somewhat
ignorant of the classics, for although
they could not, perhaps, help being Tuckers,
they needn&#8217;t have saddled their offspring
with a Christian name which would suggest
Mother Goose to every properly educated
person. However, the first Thomas grew into
a great man, healthy, wealthy, and wise, and
his descendants could hardly do less than
keep his name alive. Thomas the third was
disappointed, not to say mortified, when his
only child, born in his old age, turned out to
be a girl, but he bravely did the best he could
and named her Thomasina. Mrs. Tucker did
not like the name, but she died before the
baby was three days old. The baby hated
it herself when she reached years of discretion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
and when she found that she possessed
a voice and had a possible career before
her, she saw plainly that something
more mellifluous must be substituted if programmes
should ever be in question. Meantime
she was Tommy to her friends, and the
gay little name suited her to a T. The gay
little rhyme suited her, too, for like the
Tommy Tucker in Mother Goose, she had
to &#8220;sing for her supper&#8221;; for her breakfast,
and her dinner, and her tea also, for that
matter, if any were to be eaten.</p>
<p>Her only relation, a disagreeable bachelor
uncle, had given her a home during her
orphaned girlhood, and her first idea on growing
up was to get out of it. This she did
promptly when she secured a place in a
Brooklyn choir. The salary was modest, but
it provided a room and at least one meal a
day, not, of course, a Roman banquet, but
something to satisfy a youthful appetite. It
seemed to the intrepid possessor of a charming
voice, an equally charming face, and a
positive gift for playing accompaniments,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
that the other two meals, and a few clothes
and sundries, might be forthcoming. As a
matter of fact, they were, although the uncle
said that Tommy would starve, and he almost
hoped that she would, just to break the
back of her obstinate independence.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.4em;'>II</p>
</div>

<p>Tommy had none too much to eat, and, according
to her own æsthetic ambitions, nothing
at all to wear; but she was busy all
day long and absurdly happy. Her income
was uncertain, but that was amusing and
thrilling rather than pitiful or tragic. She
had two or three &#8220;steadies&#8221; among singers,
who gave her engagements as accompanist
at small drawing-room recitals or charitable
entertainments. There was a stout prima
donna whose arias for dramatic soprano kept
her practicing until midnight, and a rich young
lady amateur who needed a very friendly
and careful accompaniment because she sang
flat and always lost her breath before the
end of a long phrase. The manner in which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
Tommy concealed these defects was thoroughly
ingenious and sympathetic. When
Miss Guggenheim paused for breath, Tommy
filled the gap with instrumental arabesques;
when she was about to flat, Tommy gave her
the note suggestively. If she was too dreadfully
below pitch, and had breath enough to
hang on to the note so long that the audience
(always composed of invited guests) writhed
obviously, Tommy would sometimes drop
a sheet of music on the floor and create a
diversion, always apologizing profusely for
her clumsiness. The third patron was a young
baritone, who liked Miss Tucker&#8217;s appearance
on the platform and had her whenever
he didn&#8217;t sing Schubert&#8217;s &#8220;Erl König,&#8221;
which Tommy couldn&#8217;t play. This was her
most profitable engagement, but it continued
alas! for only three months, for the baritone
wanted to marry her, and she didn&#8217;t like him
because he was bald and his neck was too fat.
Also, she was afraid she would have to learn
to play the &#8220;Erl König&#8221; properly.</p>
<p>All this time Tommy was longing to sing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
in public herself, and trying to save money
enough to take more lessons by way of preparation.</p>
<p>When she lost the baritone, who was really
peevish at being rejected after suiting his
programmes to her capacities for a whole
season, Tommy conceived a new idea. She
influenced Jessie Macleod, who had a fine
contralto, and two other girls with well-trained
voices, to form a quartette.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t get anything to do separately;
perhaps we can make a pittance together,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll do good simple things; our
voices blend well, and if we practice enough
there&#8217;s no reason why we shouldn&#8217;t sing
beautifully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Singing beautifully is one thing and getting
engagements is another,&#8221; sighed Jessie
Macleod.</p>
<p>&#8220;As if I didn&#8217;t know that! We can&#8217;t hope
to be superior to other quartettes, so we must
be different&mdash;unusual, unique&mdash;I can&#8217;t
think just how at the moment, but I will before
we make our début.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>And she did, for Tommy was nothing if
not fertile in ideas.</p>
<p>Every hour that the girls could spare in the
month of October was given to rehearsal, till
the four fresh young voices were like one.
They had decided to give nothing but English
songs, to sing entirely from memory, and to
make a specialty of good words well spoken.
All the selections but one or two were to be
without accompaniment, and in these Tommy
would sit at the piano surrounded by the
other three in a little group.</p>
<p>Miss Guggenheim was to give them their
first appearance, invite fifty or sixty people,
and serve tea. She kindly offered to sing some
solos herself, but Tommy, shuddering inwardly,
said she thought it was better that
the quartette should test its own strength
unaided.</p>
<p>Miss Guggenheim couldn&#8217;t sing, but she
could dress, and she had an inspiration a
week before the concert.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to wear, girls?&#8221; she
asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Anything we have, is the general idea,&#8221;
said Tommy. &#8220;Mine is black.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s blue&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;White&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Pink!&#8221;
came from the other three.</p>
<p>&#8220;But must you wear those particular
dresses? Can&#8217;t you each compromise a little
so as to look better together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So hard to compromise when each of us
has one dress hanging on one nail; one neck
and sleeves filled up for afternoons and
ripped out for evenings!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should get four simple dresses just
alike,&#8221; said Miss Guggenheim, who had a
dozen.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if they should hang in our closets
unworn and unpaid for?&#8221; asked Jessie
Macleod.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re sure to get at least one engagement
some time or other. Nothing ventured,
nothing have. We ought to earn enough to
pay for the dresses, if we do nothing more,&#8221;&mdash;and
Tommy&#8217;s vote settled it.</p>
<p>Miss Guggenheim knew people, if she did
sing flat, and her drawing-room was full on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
the occasion of the début. Carl Bothwick, a
friend of Tommy&#8217;s, was in a publishing office,
and nobly presented programmes for the
occasion. The quartette had not thought
of naming itself, but Carl had grouped the
songs under the heading, &#8220;The Singing
Girls,&#8221; and luckily they liked the idea.</p>
<p>At four o&#8217;clock the hum of conversation
ceased at the sound of singing voices in the
distance. A sort of processional effect had
been Tommy&#8217;s suggestion, and the quartette
formed in the dressing-room and sang its
way to the audience.</p>

<p>The voices rang high and clear, coming
nearer and nearer. All the words could be
heard and understood. The hall portières divided,
and the girls entered, all in soft gray
crêpe, gardenias at the belt, little brimmed
hats of black velvet with a single gardenia on
the side, the flowers being the offering of the
dramatic soprano, who loved Tommy. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
were young, they were pretty, they sang delightfully
in tune, and with quite bewitching
effect. Several ladies fell in love with them at
first sight, and hoped that they would sing
for nothing a few times, &#8220;just to get themselves
known.&#8221; They had done nothing else
for two years, so that Tommy said they must
be acquainted with the entire State of New
York, though nothing ever came of it. It was
a joyous surprise, then, when an old gentleman
in the company (who was seen to wipe
tears away when the girls sang &#8220;Darby and
Joan&#8221;) engaged them to sing at his golden
wedding the next night. That was the beginning
of a season of modest prosperity. Tommy&#8217;s
baritone had married his new accompanist
(he seemed determined to have a piano-playing
wife), and wishing to show Miss
Tucker that his heart was not broken by her
rejection, he gave a handsome party and engaged
the quartette, paying for their services
in real coin of the realm. Other appearances
followed in and out of town, and Tommy
paid for her gray dress, spent a goodly sum
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
for an attack of tonsillitis, the result of overwork,
and still saved two hundred dollars.
The season was over. She was fagged, but
not disheartened. Who is at twenty-two?
But it was late April, and drawing-room entertainments
were no more. The two hundred
dollars when augmented by the church
salary would barely take her through till
October.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very annoying,&#8221; thought Tommy,
&#8220;when you have to eat, drink, sleep, and
dress twelve months in the year, that the
income by which you do these things should
cease abruptly for four months. Still, furriers
can&#8217;t sell furs in hot weather, and summer
boarders can&#8217;t board in winter, so I suppose
other people have to make enough money in
eight months to spend in twelve.&#8221;</p>

<p>she caroled, splashing about in her morning
tub as she finished making these reflections,
the tub being an excellent place for trills and
scales.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>Proceeding from tub to her sitting-room to
make things ready for toilet and breakfast,
her mind ran on her little problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to learn more, see more, hear
more,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I have one of those
nasty, unserviceable, betwixt-and-between
talents: voice not high enough for &#8216;Robert,
toi que j&#8217;aime,&#8217; nor low enough for &#8216;Ständchen&#8217;;
not flexible enough for &#8216;Caro Nome,&#8217;
nor big enough for &#8216;Ocean, Thou Mighty
Monster&#8217;; poor French accent, worse German;
awfully good English, but that doesn&#8217;t
count. Can sing old ballads, folk-songs,
and nice, forgotten things that make dear
old gentlemen and ladies cry&mdash;but not pay.
If I were billed at all, it ought to be</p>

<p>This appellation so tickled her fancy that
she nearly upset the coffee-pot, and she continued
to laugh at her own wit until a fat
letter was pushed under her door from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
hall outside. She picked it up. It had an
English postmark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Helena Markham!&#8221; she cried, joyously.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Tommy</span>: [the letter read]</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you want to come over to London for the
season? You never make any money at home from
June to October, and if by chance you have a
penny in the bank (I don&#8217;t know why I say &#8220;if&#8221;
when none of us ever had such a thing!) I think
I can put enough in your way to pay part of your
expenses. I am really beginning to get on!&mdash;three
engagements in the provincial towns all arranged.
My accompanist plays lots better than
you do, but I don&#8217;t sing half so well with him
as I used to with you. You somehow infuse the
spirit into me that I lack. I incline to be lumpy
and heavy. They may not notice it in the
provinces, for I dare say they are lumpy and
heavy there, too. However, though I shall have
to have somebody well known over here for concerts
of any great pretensions, I could work you
into smaller ones, and coach with you, too, since
I must have somebody. And you are so good-looking,
Tommy dear, and have such a winning
profile! I am plainer than ever, but no plainer
than Madame Titiens, so the papers say. I never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
saw or heard her, of course, but the critics say
I have the same large, &#8220;massive&#8221; style of voice
and person. My present accompanist would take
first prize for ugliness in any competition; he is
more like a syndicate of plainness than one single
exemplification of it! I must have a noble nature
to think more of my audiences than of myself,
but I should like to give them something to please
their eyes&mdash;I flatter myself I can take care of
their ears!</p>
<p>Oh, do come, Tommy! Say you will!</p>

<p>Tommy pirouetted about the room like
an intoxicated bird, waving the letter, and
trilling and running joyful chromatic scales,
for the most part badly done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will I go to London?&#8221; she warbled in a
sort of improvised recitative. &#8220;Will I take
two or two and a half lessons of Georg Henschel?
Will I grace platforms in the English
provinces? Will I take my two hundred dollars
out of the bank and risk it royally? Perhaps
the bystanders will glance in at my

notice, and packing my trunk, both of

<p>Fergus Appleton thought he saw &#8220;the singing
girl&#8221; of his voyage from New York one
May day in Wells, where he went to study
the cathedral. He noticed a hansom with a
pink-clad figure in the opening, looking like
a rosebud of a new and odd sort on wheels.
At least, it looked like a rosebud at the moment
the doors rolled back like the leaves of
a calyx, and the flower issued, triumphant
and beautiful. She was greeted by a tall,
stout young lady, who climbed into the hansom,
and the two settled themselves quickly
and drove off.</p>
<p>Appleton&#8217;s hansom followed on its own
course, which chanced to be in the same direction,
and he saw the slim and the stout
disappear up a hilly street, at the top of
which was a famous old house. He walked
that way in the afternoon, having nothing
better to do, but could observe no dwelling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
at which the two ladies might be staying.
There was a pretty cottage with a long,
graveled pathway leading to it, and a little
sign on the locked gate reading: &#8220;Spring
Cleaning. Please do not knock or ring.&#8221;
Farther along was a more pretentious house,
so attractive that he was sorry he had never
noticed it before, for the sign &#8220;Apartments
to Let&#8221; was in one of the front windows. He
heard a piano in the rear somewhere, but on
reaching the front door another sign confronted
him: &#8220;The parlor maid is slightly
deaf. If doorbell is not answered at once,
please step inside and ring the dinner bell
on the hall table.&#8221;</p>
<p>This somehow required more courage than
Appleton possessed, though he determined
to look at the rooms on his next visit, so he
stole down the path and went about his business,
wondering why in the world he had
done such a besotted thing as to take a walk
among the furnished lodgings of the cathedral
town of Wells.</p>
<p>The summer waxed. He had nearly finished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
his book, and feeling the need of some
peaceful retreat where he could do the last
chapters and work up his sketches, he took
the advice of an English friend and went
down to Devonshire, intending to go from
place to place until he found a hotel and
surroundings to his mind.</p>
<p>The very first one pleased his exacting
taste, and he felt that the Bexley Sands Inn
would be the very spot in which to write;
comfortable within, a trifle too large, perhaps,
and at week-ends too full of people,
but clean, well-kept, and sunny.</p>
<p>It was a Friday evening, and the number
of guests who arrived on the last train from
Torquay was rather disturbing. The dining-room
service was not interfered with, but
Appleton made up his mind to smoke his
pipe in his own sitting-room and go down to
the lounge later to read the papers, when the
crowd might have dispersed. At nine o&#8217;clock,
accordingly, he descended, and was preparing
to settle himself with the last &#8220;Spectator&#8221;
when the young lady in the office observed:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
&#8220;There&#8217;s a very good concert going on in
the drawing-room, sir, if you enjoy music.
No admittance, you know; just a plate at
the door as you leave&mdash;quite optional.&#8221;</p>
<p>Appleton bowed his thanks, filled his pipe,
and taking up his newspaper with a sensation
of comfortable idleness, was beginning an
article on the situation in the Balkans, when
a voice floated out from the distant drawing-room,
down the long corridor, through the
writing-room into the lounge. It was not a
little voice nor a big voice, it seemed to have
no extraordinarily high notes and no low ones,
it did not arrest attention by the agility of its
use; but it was as fresh and young as a bird&#8217;s
and sweeter than honey in the comb. It began
by caroling &#8220;My Love&#8217;s an Arbutus,&#8221;
went on to &#8220;The Little Red Lark&#8221; and
&#8220;The Low-Backed Car,&#8221; so that Appleton,
his head thrown back in the easy-chair, the
smoke wreaths from his pipe circling in the
air, the Balkans forgotten, decided that the
singer was Irish.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty voice, sir,&#8221; remarked the goddess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
of the hotel office. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry so many
of our guests are playing bowls this evening,
and there&#8217;s a bridge party of three tables
in our first-floor private sitting-room, or the
young lady would have had an audience.
She seems a nice little thing, quite a stranger,
with no experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the singer had even a small group of
hearers, they were apparently delighted with
&#8220;The Low-Backed Car,&#8221; for with only a
second&#8217;s pause she gave &#8220;The Minstrel Boy.&#8221;
A certain individual quality of tone and
spirit managed to bridge the distance between
the drawing-room and lounge; or perhaps
it was the piano accompaniment, so
beautifully played that one could almost
imagine it a harp; or was it that the words
were so familiar to Appleton that every
syllable was understood, so that the passion
and fire of the old song suffered no loss?</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity her programme is so old-fashioned,&#8221;
said the young lady of the office,
passing his chair to give an order to the page.
&#8220;It&#8217;s true only the elderly people went in,
but our week-enders are very up-to-date
in everything. There&#8217;s a lot of Londoners
here, and those from Torquay are frightfully
musical. If they don&#8217;t get Debewssy, it
seems they think nothing of the programme.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I confess that Debussy seems a
trifle alien to this time and place,&#8221; said Appleton,
&#8220;and these old ballads suit my taste
much better. I think I&#8217;ll take a nearer view.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shoved his pipe into its case and
strolled down the corridor, pausing behind
the heavy velvet portières that shut off the
drawing-room. There was no buzz of conversation
going on, because there was not
a sufficient number of persons to buzz. A
very quiet, stodgy audience it was, with no
friendly grouping; just a few old gentlemen
here and a few old ladies there, sometimes
with their prematurely aged and chastened
paid companions by their sides. There were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
some girls of fifteen or sixteen, too, scattered
about, a few of them accompanied by prim
governesses.</p>
<p>Appleton heard the entrance of some one
from the anteroom beyond the grand piano,
then a few chords, struck by hands that loved
the ivory keys and evoked a reciprocal tenderness
every time they touched them; then:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Near Woodstock Town in Oxfordshire</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>As I walked forth to take the air,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>To view the fields and meadows round,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Methought I heard a mournful sound.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>So the chronicle ran on until the crisis came:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;The lady round the meadow ran,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And gathered flowers as they sprang.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Of every sort she there did pull</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Until she got her apron full.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The history of the distracted lady&#8217;s unhappy
passion persevered:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;The green ground served her as a bed,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>The flowers a pillow for her head.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>She laid her down and nothing spoke.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Alas! for love her heart was broke.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Appleton was at first too enchanted with
the mischievous yet sympathetic rendition of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
this tragedy to do anything but listen. The
voice, the speech, were so full of color and personality
he forgot for the moment that there
would be a face behind them; but there was
an irresistible something in the line, &#8220;Until
she got her apron full,&#8221; that forced him to
peep behind the curtain just in time to catch
the singer&#8217;s smile.</p>
<p>As this is not a story of plot, suspense, or
mystery, there is no earthly use in denying
that the lady in question was Miss Thomasina
Tucker, nor any sense in affirming that
her appearance in Fergus Appleton&#8217;s hotel
was in the nature of a dramatic coincidence,
since Americans crossing the Atlantic on the
same steamer are continually meeting in the
British Isles and on the Continent.</p>
<p>Appleton was pleased to see the girl again
because he had always liked her face, and he
was delighted to find that her voice not only
harmonized with it, but increased its charm a
hundredfold. Miss Tommy had several rather
uncommon qualities in her equipment. One
was that when she sang a high note she did it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
without exposing any of the avenues which
led to her singing apparatus. She achieved her
effects without pain to herself or to the observer,
just flinging them off as gayly and
irresponsibly as a bird on a bough, without
showing any <i>modus operandi</i>. She had tenderness
also, and fire, and a sense of humor which,
while she never essayed a &#8220;comic&#8221; song,
served her in good stead in certain old ballads
with an irresistibly quaint twist in them.
She made it perfectly clear that she was
sorry for the poor lady who was running
around the meadow preparing her flowery
bier, but the conviction crept over you that
she was secretly amused at the same time.
Appleton heard the smile in her voice before
he pulled aside the curtain and saw its counterpart
on her face; heard and responded, for
when Tommy tossed a smile at you, you
caught it gratefully and tossed it back in the
hope of getting a second and a third.</p>
<p>Another arrow in Tommy&#8217;s modest quiver
was the establishment of an instantaneous
intimacy between herself and her audience.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
The singing of her songs was precisely like
the narration of so many stories, told so simply
and directly that the most hardened critic
would have his sting removed without being
aware of it. He would know that Tommy
hadn&#8217;t a remarkable voice, but he would forget
to mention it because space was limited.
Sometimes he would say that she was an interpreter
rather than a singer, and Tommy,
for her part, was glad to be called anything,
and grateful when she wasn&#8217;t brutally arraigned
for the microscopic size of her talent.</p>
<p>It was Tommy&#8217;s captivating friendliness
and the quality of her smile that &#8220;did&#8221; for
the shyest and stiffest of men, for by the time
she had finished her programme the thunderbolt,
the classic, the eternal thunderbolt, had
fallen, and Fergus Appleton was in love.
Tommy began her unconscious depredations
with &#8220;Near Woodstock Town&#8221; and &#8220;Phillida
Flouts Me,&#8221; added fuel to the flames with
&#8220;My Heart&#8217;s in the Highlands&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie
Is My Darling,&#8221; and reduced his heart to
ashes with &#8220;Allan Water&#8221; and &#8220;Has Sorrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
Thy Young Days Shaded?&#8221; The smile
began it, but it was tears that worked the
final miracle, though moisture very rarely
has this effect on fires of any sort.</p>
<p>Tommy was tired and a bit disheartened;
Appleton, the only responsive person in the
audience, was seated in a far corner of the
room, completely hidden behind a lady of
formidable width and thickness, so the singer
could not be expected to feel the tidal waves
of appreciation he was sending toward her, although
they ran so high at one moment that
he could have risen to his feet and begged her
to elope with him. The rest of her hearers sat
heavily, stodgily in their seats without moving
a muscle, mental, emotional, or physical.
They had no private sitting-rooms, and they
might as well be where they were as anywhere
else; that was the idea they conveyed
in every feature of their expressionless faces.
An old gentleman in the front row left the
room during the last song on the programme,
and Appleton was beset by, and resisted, a
vulgar temptation to put out his foot and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
trip him up in the doorway. When Tommy
sang:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Has hope, like the bird in the story,</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, a thousand times yes,&#8221; answered
Fergus Appleton&#8217;s heart, for the first time in
his life conscious of loneliness, lack of purpose,
lack of anchorage, lack of responsibilities,
lack of everything he had never wanted
before, but wanted desperately all at once,
and quite independent of logic.</p>
<p>He slipped out of the door and let the scattered
units in the audience assemble, pass
him, and drift down the corridor toward the
office and lounge. To his astonishment and
anger they dropped shillings on the plate,
and the young people sixpences and, great
Heavens! even pennies; one half-crown, the
tacit apology of the old gentleman who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
left early, was the only respectable offering.
Appleton took out a sovereign, and then was
afraid to put it in the collection for fear of
exciting the singer&#8217;s curiosity, so he rummaged
his pockets for half-crowns and two-shilling
pieces. Finding only two or three, he changed
his mind and put back the gold-piece just in
time to avoid the eye of the page, who came
to take the offering back to Miss Tucker.
Appleton twisted his mustache nervously,
and walked slowly toward the anteroom with
no definite idea in mind, save perhaps that
she might issue from her retreat and recognize
him as she passed. (As a matter of fact she
had never once noticed him on the steamer,
but the poor wretch was unconscious of that
misfortune!) The page came out, putting
something in his pocket, and left the door
half open behind him. Appleton wheeled
swiftly, feeling like a spy, but not until he
had seen Miss Thomasina Tucker take a large
copper coin from the plate, fling it across the
room, bury the plate of silver upside down in a
sofa cushion, and precipitate herself upon it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
with a little quivering wail of shame, or disappointment,
or rage, he could hardly determine
which.</p>
<p>Appleton followed the unfeeling, unmusical,
penurious old ladies and gentlemen back
into the lounge, glaring at them as belligerently
and offensively as a gentleman could
and maintain his self-respect. Then he went
into the waiting-room and embarked upon a
positive orgy of letter-writing. Looking up
from the last of his pile a half-hour later, he
observed the young lady who was unconsciously
preventing a proper flow of epistolary
inspiration on his part, seated at a desk in the
opposite corner. A pen was in her right hand,
and in her left she held a tiny embroidered
handkerchief, rather creased. Sometimes she
bit the corner of it, sometimes she leaned her
cheek upon it, sometimes she tapped the blotting-pad
with the pen-handle, very much as
if she had no particular interest in what she
was doing, or else she was very doubtful
about the wisdom of it.</p>
<p>Presently she took some pennies from a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
small purse, and rising, took her letters with
her with the evident intention of posting
them. Appleton rose too, lifting his pile of
correspondence, and followed close at her
heels. She went to the office, laid down threepence,
with her letters, turned, saw Fergus
Appleton with the physical eye, but looked
directly through him as if he were a man of
glass and poor quality of glass at that, and
sauntered upstairs as if she were greatly
bored with life.</p>
<p>However, the top letter of her three was
addressed very plainly to the &#8220;Bishop of
Bath and Wells,&#8221; and Fergus Appleton had
known the bishop, and the bishop&#8217;s wife,
for several years. Accordingly, the post-bag
that night held two letters addressed to the
Bishop&#8217;s Palace, and there was every prospect
of an immediate answer to one of them.</p>

<p>As for the country roundabout the Bexley
Sands Inn, it is one of the loveliest in Devonshire.
It does not waste a moment, but, realizing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
the brevity of week-end visits and the
anxiety of tourists to see the greatest amount
of scenery in the shortest space, it begins its
duty at the very door of the inn and goes
straight on from one stretch of loveliness to
another.</p>
<p>If you have been there, you remember that
if you turn to the right and go over the stone
bridge that crosses the sleepy river, you are
in the very heart of beauty. You pick your
way daintily along the edge of the road, for it
is carpeted so thickly with sea-pinks and yellow
and crimson crow&#8217;s-foot that you scarcely
know where to step. Sea-poppies there are,
too, groves of them, growing in the sandy
stretches that lie close to and border the wide,
shingly beach. In summer the long, low, narrow
stone bridge crosses no water, but just
here is an acre or two of tall green rushes.
You walk down the bank a few steps and sit
under the shadow of a wall. The green garden
of rushes stretches in front of you, with a still,
shallow pool between you and it, a pool floating
with blossoming water-weeds. On the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
edge of the rushes grow tall yellow irises in
great profusion; the cuckoo&#8217;s note sounds in
the distance; the sun, the warmth, the intoxication
of color, make you drowsy, and you lean
back among the green things, close your eyes,
and then begin listening to the wonderful
music of the rushes. A million million reeds
stirred by the breeze bend to and fro, making
a faint silken sound like that of a summer
wave lapping the shore, but far more
ethereal.</p>
<p>Thomasina Tucker went down the road,
laden with books, soon after breakfast Monday
morning. Appleton waited until after the
post came in, and having received much-desired
letters and observed with joy the week-enders
setting forth, hither and thither on
their return journeys, followed what he supposed
to be Miss Tucker&#8217;s route; at least, it
was her route on Saturday and Sunday, and
he could not suppose her to harbor caprice
or any other feminine weakness.</p>
<p>Yes, there she was, in the very loveliest
nook, the stone wall at her back, and in front
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
nice sandy levels for books and papers and
writing-pad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Tucker, may I invade your solitude
for a moment? Our mutual friend, the Bishop
of Bath and Wells, has written asking me to
look you up as a fellow countryman and see
if I can be of any service to you so far away
from home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tommy looked up, observed a good-looking
American holding a letter in one hand and
lifting a hat with the other, and bade him
welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;How kind of the bishop! But he is always
doing kind things; his wife, too. I have seen
much of them since I came to England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Appleton, Fergus Appleton,
at your service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you take a stone, or make yourself
a hollow in the sand?&#8221; asked Tommy hospitably.
&#8220;I came out here to read and study,
and get rid of the week-enders. Isn&#8217;t Bexley
Sands a lovely spot, and do you ever get tired
of the bacon and the kippered herring, and
the fruit tarts with Devonshire cream?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to begin an acquaintance
with a lady by differing on such vital points,
but I do get tired of these Bexley delicacies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you have been here too long&mdash;or
have you just come this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>Appleton swallowed his disappointment
and hurt vanity, and remarked: &#8220;No, I came
on Friday.&#8221; (He laid some emphasis on Friday.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The evening train is so incorrigibly slow!
I only reached the hotel at ten o&#8217;clock when
I arrived on Thursday night.&#8221; Miss Tucker
shot a rapid glance at the young man as she
made this remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came by the morning express and arrived
here at three on Friday,&#8221; said Appleton.</p>
<p>Miss Tucker, with a slight display of perhaps
legitimate temper, turned suddenly
upon him. &#8220;There! I have been trying for
two minutes to find out when you came, and
now I know you were at my beastly concert
on Friday evening!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly was, and very grateful I am,
too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose all through my life people will
be turning up who were in that room!&#8221; said
Miss Tucker ungraciously. &#8220;I must tell somebody
what I feel about that concert! I should
prefer some one who wasn&#8217;t a stranger, but
you are a great deal better than nobody. Do
you mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>Appleton laughed like a boy, and flung
his hat a little distance into a patch of sea-pinks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit. Use me, or abuse me, as you
like, so long as you don&#8217;t send me away, for
this was my favorite spot before you chose
it for yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I live in New York, and I came abroad
early in the summer,&#8221; began Tommy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that already!&#8221; interrupted Appleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose the bishop told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I came with you; that is, I was your
fellow passenger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you? Why, I never saw you on the
boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My charms are not so dazzling that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
expect them to be noted and remembered,&#8221;
laughed Appleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true I was very tired, and excited,
and full of anxieties,&#8221; said Tommy meekly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t apologize! If you tried for an hour,
you couldn&#8217;t guess just why I noticed and
remembered <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I conclude then it was not for <i>my</i> dazzling
charms,&#8221; Tommy answered saucily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was because you wore the only flower
I ever notice, one that is associated with my
earliest childhood. I never knew a woman
to wear a bunch of mignonette before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one sent it to me, I remember, and
it had some hideous scarlet pinks in the middle.
I put the pinks in my room and pinned
on the mignonette because it matched my
dress. I am very fond of green.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother loved mignonette. We always
had beds of it in our garden and pots of
it growing in the house in winter. I can smell
it whenever I close my eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tommy glanced at him. She felt something
in his voice that she liked, something that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
attracted her and wakened an instantaneous
response.</p>
<p>&#8220;But go on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I only know as yet
that you sailed from New York in the early
summer, as I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I went to London to join a great
friend, a singer, Helena Markham. Have you
heard of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; is she an American?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a Western girl, from Montana, with
oh! such a magnificent voice and such a big
talent!&#8221; (The outward sweep of Tommy&#8217;s
hands took in the universe.) &#8220;We&#8217;ve had
some heavenly weeks together. I play accompaniments,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot for the moment how much too
much you know! I went with her to Birmingham,
and Manchester, and Leeds, and Liverpool.
I wasn&#8217;t really grand enough for her,
but the audiences didn&#8217;t notice me, Helena
was so superb. In between I took some lessons
of Henschel. He told me I hadn&#8217;t much
voice, but very nice brains. I am always called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
&#8216;intelligent,&#8217; and no one can imagine how
I hate the word!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is offensive, but not so bad as some
others. I, for example, have been called a
&#8216;conscientious writer&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, are you a writer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of a sort, yes. But, as you were saying&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I was saying, everything was going so
beautifully until ten days ago, when Helena&#8217;s
people cabled her to come home. Her mother
is seriously ill and cannot live more than a
few months. She went at once, but I couldn&#8217;t
go with her&mdash;not very well, in midsummer&mdash;and
so here I am, all alone, high and dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned her chin in the cup of her hand
and, looking absent-mindedly at the shimmering
rushes, fell into a spell of silence that took
no account of Appleton.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, he didn&#8217;t mind looking
at her unobserved for a moment or two. He
had almost complete control of his senses,
and he didn&#8217;t believe she could be as pretty
as he thought she was. There was no reason
to think that she was better to look at than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
an out-and-out beauty. Her nose wasn&#8217;t
Greek. It was just a trifle faulty, but it was
piquant and full of mischief. There was nothing
to be said against her mouth or her eyelashes,
which were beyond criticism, and he
particularly liked the way her dark-brown
hair grew round her temples and her ears&mdash;but
the quality in her face that appealed most
to Appleton was a soft and touching youthfulness.</p>
<p>Suddenly she remembered herself, and began
again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Markham and I had twice gone to
large seaside hotels with great success, but,
of course, she had a manager and a reputation.
I thought I would try the same thing
alone in some very quiet retreat, and see if
it would do. Oh! wasn&#8217;t it funny!&#8221; (Here she
broke into a perfectly childlike fit of laughter.)
&#8220;It was such a well-behaved, solemn
little audience, that never gave me an inkling
of its liking or its loathing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it did!&#8221; remonstrated Appleton.
&#8220;They loved your Scotch songs.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Silently!&#8221; cried Tommy. &#8220;I had dozens
and dozens of other things upstairs to sing to
them, but I thought I was suiting my programme
to the place and the people. I looked
at them during luncheon and made my selections.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are flattering the week-enders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are musical,&#8221; she ventured,
looking up at him as she played with a tuft
of sea-pinks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am passionately fond of singing, so I
seldom go to concerts,&#8221; he answered, somewhat
enigmatically. &#8220;Your programme was
an enchanting one to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was good of its kind, if the audience
would have helped me,&#8221;&mdash;and Tommy&#8217;s lip
trembled a little; &#8220;but perhaps I could have
borne that, if it hadn&#8217;t been for the&mdash;plate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a pleasant custom, and a new one to
me,&#8221; said Appleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to me!&#8221; (Here she made a little
grimace of disgust.) &#8220;I knew beforehand I
had to face the plate&mdash;but the contents!
Where did you sit?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was forced to stay a trifle in the background,
I entered so late. It was your &#8216;Minstrel
Boy&#8217; that dragged me out of my armchair
in the lounge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you saw the plate? I know
by your face that you did! You saw the sixpences,
which I shall never forget, and the
pennies, which I will never forgive! I thirst for
the blood of those who put in pennies!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They would all have been sitting in boiling
oil since Friday if I had had my way,&#8221;
responded Appleton.</p>
<p>Tommy laughed delightedly. &#8220;I know now
who put in the sovereign! I knew every face
in that audience&mdash;that wasn&#8217;t difficult in
so small a one&mdash;and I tried and tried to fix
the sovereign on any one of them, and couldn&#8217;t.
At last I determined that it was the old
gentleman who went out in the middle of
&#8216;Allan Water,&#8217; feeling that he would rather
pay anything than stay any longer. Confess!
it <i>was</i> you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Appleton felt very sheepish as he met
Tommy&#8217;s dancing eyes and heightened color.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t bear to let you see those pennies,&#8221;
he stammered, &#8220;but I couldn&#8217;t get
them out before the page came to take the
plate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you were &#8216;pound foolish,&#8217; and
the others were &#8216;penny wise,&#8217; but it was awfully
nice of you. If I can pay my bill here
without spending that sovereign, I believe
I&#8217;ll keep it for a lucky piece. I shall be very
rich by Saturday night, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A legacy due?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, no! I haven&#8217;t a relation in
the world except one, who disapproves of me;
not so much as I disapprove of him, however.
No, Albert Spalding and Donald Tovey have
engaged me for a concert in Torquay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have some business in Torquay which
will keep me there for a few days on my way
back to Wells,&#8221; said Appleton nonchalantly.
(The bishop&#8217;s letter had been a pure and undefiled
source of information on all points.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how funny! I hope you&#8217;ll be there
on Saturday. There&#8217;ll be no plate! Tickets
two and six to seven and six, but you shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
be my guest, my sovereign guest. I am going
to Wells myself to stay till&mdash;till I make up
my mind about a few things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;America next?&#8221; inquired Appleton, keeping
his voice as colorless as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Helena made me resign my
church position in Brooklyn, and for the moment
my &#8216;career&#8217; is undecided.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed, but her eyes denied the mirth
that her lips affirmed, and Appleton had such
a sudden, illogical desire to meddle with her
career, to help or hinder it, to have a hand
in it at any rate, that he could hardly hold his
tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Torquay concert will be charming,
I hope. You know what Spalding&#8217;s violin-playing
is, and Donald Tovey is a young
genius at piano-playing and composing. He
is going to accompany me in some of his
own songs, and he wants me to sing a group
of American ones&mdash;Macdowell, Chadwick,
Nevin, Mrs. Beach, and Margaret Lang.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll accompany yourself in some
of your own ballads!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, the occasion is too grand; unless
they should happen to like me very much.
Then I could play for myself, and sing
&#8216;Allan Water,&#8217; or &#8216;Believe Me,&#8217; or &#8216;Early
One Morning,&#8217; or &#8216;Barbara Allen.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>(Appleton wondered if a claque of sizable,
trustworthy boys could be secured in Torquay,
and under his intelligent and inspired
leadership carry Miss Thomasina Tucker
like a cork on the wave of success.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be lunch-time?&#8221; asked Miss
Tucker, after a slight pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is always time for something when I&#8217;m
particularly enjoying myself,&#8221; grumbled Appleton,
looking at his watch. &#8220;It&#8217;s not quite
one o&#8217;clock. Must we go in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; we&#8217;ve ten minutes&#8217; walk,&#8221;&mdash;and
Tommy scrambled up and began to
brush sand from her skirts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I sit at your table&mdash;under
the chaperonage of the Bishop of Bath and
Wells?&#8221; And Appleton got on his feet and
collected Tommy&#8217;s books.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s laugh was full-hearted this time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What does Bexley
Sands know of the bishop and his interest in
us? But if you can find the drawing-room utterly
deserted at any time, I&#8217;ll sing for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about a tea-basket and a walk to
Gray Rocks at four o&#8217;clock?&#8221; asked Appleton
as they strolled toward the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charming! And I love singing out of
doors without accompaniment. I&#8217;m determined
to earn that sovereign in course of
time! Are you from New England?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m from New York. I was born in
a row of brown-stone fronts, in a numbered
street, twenty-five or thirty houses to a
block, all exactly alike. I wonder how I&#8217;ve
outlived my start. And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the country, bless it,&mdash;in the eastern
part of Massachusetts. We had a garden and
my mother and I lived in it during all the
months of my life that matter. That&#8217;s where
the mignonette grew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And He planted a garden eastward in
Eden,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Tommy, half to herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only Eden I ever knew! Do you
like it over here, Miss Tucker, or are you
homesick now that your friend is in America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m never homesick; for the reason
that I have never had any home since I was
ten years old, when I was left an orphan. I
haven&#8217;t any deep roots in New York; it&#8217;s
like the ocean, too big to love. I respect and
admire the ocean, but I love a little river.
You know the made-over aphorism: &#8216;The
home is where the hat is&#8217;? For &#8216;hat&#8217; read
&#8216;trunk,&#8217; and you have my case, precisely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you are absurdly, riotously
young! It won&#8217;t suit you forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does anything suit one forever?&#8221; asked
Tommy frivolously, not cynically, but making
Appleton a trifle uncomfortable nevertheless.
&#8220;Anything except singing, I mean? Perhaps
you feel the same way about writing?
You haven&#8217;t told me anything about your
work, and I&#8217;ve confided my past history,
present prospects, and future aspirations to
you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not so much to say. It is good
work, and it is growing better. I studied architecture
at the Beaux-Arts. I do art-criticism,
and I write about buildings chiefly. That
would seem rather dull to a warbler like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit. Doesn&#8217;t somebody say that
architecture is frozen music?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get as immediate response to my
work as you do to yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but you never had sixpences and
pennies put into your plate! Now give me
my books, please. I&#8217;ll go in at the upper gate
alone, and run upstairs to my room. You
enter by the lower one and go through the
lounge, where the guests chiefly congregate
waiting for the opening of the dining-room.
Au revoir!&#8221;</p>
<p>When Tommy opened her bedroom door
she elevated her pretty, impertinent little
nose and sniffed the air. It was laden with
a delicate perfume that came from a huge
bunch of mignonette on the table. It was
long-stemmed, fresh, and moist, loosely bound
together, and every one of its tiny brown blossoms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
was sending out fragrance into the room.
It did not need Fergus Appleton&#8217;s card to
identify the giver, but there it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a nice, kind, understanding person
he is! And how cheerful it makes life to have
somebody from your own country taking an
interest in you, and liking your singing, and
hating those beastly pennies!&#8221; And Tommy,
quickly merging artist in woman, slipped on
a coatee of dull-green crêpe over her old black
taffeta, and taking down her hat with the garland
of mignonette from the shelf in her closet,
tucked some of the green sprays in her belt,
and went down to luncheon. She didn&#8217;t know
where Fergus Appleton&#8217;s table was, but she
would make her seat face his. Then she could
smile thanks at him over the mulligatawny
soup, or the filet of sole, or the boiled mutton,
or the apple tart. Even the Bishop of Bath
and Wells couldn&#8217;t object to that!</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.4em;'>V</p>

<p>Their friendship grew perceptibly during
the next two days, though constantly under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
the espionage of the permanent guests of the
Bexley Sands Inn, but on Wednesday night
Miss Tucker left for Torquay, according to
schedule. Fergus Appleton remained behind,
partly to make up arrears in his literary work,
and partly as a sop to decency and common
sense. He did not deem it either proper or
dignified to escort the young lady on her
journey (particularly as he had not been asked
to do so), so he pined in solitary confinement
at Bexley until Saturday morning, when he
followed her to the scene of her labors.</p>
<p>After due reflection he gave up the idea of
the claque, and rested Tommy&#8217;s case on the
knees of the gods, where it transpired that
it was much safer, for Torquay liked Tommy,
and the concert went off with enormous éclat.
From the moment that Miss Thomasina
Tucker appeared on the platform the audience
looked pleased. She wore a quaint dress
of white flounced chiffon, with a girdle of
green, and a broad white hat with her old
mignonette garland made into two little nosegays
perched on either side of the transparent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
brim. She could not wear the mignonette
that Appleton had sent to her dressing-room,
because she would have been obscured by
the size of the offering, but she carried as
much of it as her strength permitted, and
laid the fragrant bouquet on the piano as she
passed it. (A poem had come with it, but
Tommy did not dare read it until the ordeal
was over, for no one had ever written her a
poem before. It had three long verses, and
was signed &#8220;F.A.&#8221;&mdash;that was all she had
time to note.)</p>
<p>A long-haired gentleman sitting beside
Appleton remarked to his neighbor: &#8220;The
girl looks like a flower; it&#8217;s a pity she has such
a heathenish name! Why didn&#8217;t they call her
Hope, or Flora, or Egeria, or Cecilia?&#8221;</p>
<p>When the audience found that Miss Tucker&#8217;s
singing did not belie her charming appearance,
they cast discretion to the winds
and loved her. Appleton himself marveled at
the beauty of her performance as it budded
and bloomed under the inspiration of her fellow
artists and the favor of the audience, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the more he admired the more depressed he
became.</p>
<p>&#8220;She may be on the threshold of a modest
&#8216;career,&#8217; of a sort, after all,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and
she will never give it up for me. Would she
be willing to combine me with the career, and
how would it work? I shouldn&#8217;t be churl
enough to mind her singing now and then,
but it seems to me I couldn&#8217;t stand &#8216;tours.&#8217;
Besides, hers is such a childlike, winsome,
fragrant little gift it ought not to be exploited
like a great, booming talent!&#8221;</p>
<p>The audience went wild over Donald
Tovey&#8217;s songs. He played, and Tommy sang
them from memory, and it seemed as if they
had been written then and there, struck off
at white heat; as if the composer happened
to be at the piano, and the singer chanced
with his help to be interpreting those particular
verses for that particular moment.</p>
<p>His setting of &#8220;Jock o&#8217;Hazeldean&#8221; proved
irresistible:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;They sought her baith by bower an ha&#8217;;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 1.1037527593819em;'>The ladie was not seen.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>And then with a swirl and a torrent of
sound, a clangor of sword and a clatter of
hoofs:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;She&#8217;s o&#8217;er the Border and awa&#8217;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Appleton didn&#8217;t see any valid reason why
Tovey should kiss Tommy&#8217;s hand in responding
to the third recall, but supposed it must
be a composer&#8217;s privilege, and wished that
he were one.</p>
<p>Then the crowd made its way into the
brilliant Torquay sunshine, and Appleton
lingered in the streets until the time came for
the tea-party arranged for the artists at the
hotel.</p>
<p>It was a gay little gathering, assisted by a
charming lady of the town, who always knew
the celebrated people who flock there in all
seasons. Spalding and Tovey were the lions,
but Miss Thomasina Tucker did not lack for
compliments. Her cheeks glowed and her
eyes sparkled under the white tulle brim of
her hat. Her neck looked deliciously white
and young, rising from its transparent chiffons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
and her bunch of mignonette gave a
note of delicate distinction. The long-haired
gentleman was present, and turned out to
be a local poet. He told Miss Tucker that
she ought never to wear or to carry another
flower. &#8220;Not, at all events, till you pass
thirty!&#8221; he said. &#8220;You belong together&mdash;you,
your songs, and the mignonette!&#8221;&mdash;at
which she flung a shy upward glance at Appleton,
saying: &#8220;It is this American friend
who has really established the connection,
though I have always worn green and white
and always loved the flower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sent me some verses, Mr. Appleton,&#8221;
she said, as the poet moved away. &#8220;I have
them safe&#8221; (and she touched her bodice),
&#8220;but I haven&#8217;t had a quiet moment to read
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a little tribute,&#8221; Appleton answered
carelessly. &#8220;Are you leaving? If so, I&#8217;ll get
your flowers into a cab and drive you on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I am going, quite unexpectedly, to
Exeter to-night. Let us sit down in this
corner a moment and I&#8217;ll tell you. Mr. Tovey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
has asked me to substitute for a singer who
is ill. The performance is on Monday and I
chance to know the cantata. I shall not be
paid, but it will be a fine audience and it may
lead to something; after all, it&#8217;s not out of
my way in going to Wells.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you overtired to travel any more
to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am treading air! I have no sense
of being in the body at all. Mrs. Cholmondeley,
that dark-haired lady you were talking
with a moment ago, lives in Exeter and
will take me to her house. And how nice that
I don&#8217;t have to say good-bye, for you still
mean to go to Wells?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! I haven&#8217;t nearly finished with
the cathedral&mdash;I shall be there before you.
Can I look up lodgings or do anything for
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, thank you. I shall go to the old
place where Miss Markham and I lived before.
The bishop and Mrs. Kennion sent us
there because there is a piano, and the old
ladies, being deaf, don&#8217;t mind musical lodgers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
Didn&#8217;t the concert go off beautifully! Such
artists, those two men; so easy to do one&#8217;s
best in such company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a triumph! Doesn&#8217;t it completely
efface the memory of the plate and the
pennies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Tommy answered. &#8220;I bear no ill-will
to any living creature. The only flaw is
my horrid name. Can&#8217;t you think of another
for me? I&#8217;ve just had an anonymous
note. Hear it!&#8221; (taking it from her glove):</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Madam</span>:</p>
<p>The name of Thomasina Tucker is one of those
bizarre Americanisms that pain us so frequently
in England. I fancy you must have assumed it for
public use, and if so, I beg you will change it now,
before you become too famous. The grotesque
name of Thomasina Tucker belittles your exquisite
art.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:4em;'>Very truly yours,</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Well Wisher.</span></p>
</div>

</div>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Appleton laughed heartily and scanned
the note. &#8220;It is from some doddering old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
woman,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The name given you
by your sponsors in baptism to be condemned
as a &#8216;bizarre Americanism&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot think why the loyalty of my
dear mother and father to Tucker, and to
Thomas, should have made them saddle me
with such a handicap! They might have
known I was going to sing, for I bawled
incessantly from birth to the age of twelve
months. I shall have to change my name,
and you must help me to choose. Au revoir!&#8221;&mdash;and
she darted away with a handshake
and a friendly backward glance from the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I think of another name for her?&#8221;
apostrophized Appleton to himself. &#8220;Can
feminine unconsciousness and cruelty go
farther than that? Another name for her
shrieks from the very housetops, and I agree
with &#8216;Well Wisher&#8217; that she ought to take
it before she becomes too famous; before
it would be necessary, for instance, to describe
her as Madame Tucker-Appleton!&#8221;

</div>

<p>There was never such a summer of enchanting
weather as that particular summer
in Wells. The whole population of Somersetshire,
save those who had crops requiring
rain, were in a heaven of delight from
morning till night. Miss Tommy Tucker
was very busy with some girl pupils, and as
accompanist for oratorio practice; but there
were blissful hours when she &#8220;studied&#8221; the
cathedral with Fergus Appleton, watching
him sketch the stately Central Tower, or
the Lady Chapel, or the Chain Gate. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
were afternoon walks to Tor Hill, winding
up almost daily with tea at the palace, for
the bishop and his wife were miracles of
hospitality to the two Americans.</p>
<p>Fergus Appleton had declared the state of
his mind and heart to Mrs. Kennion a few days
after his arrival, though after his confidence
had been received she said that it was quite
unnecessary, as she had guessed the entire situation
the moment she saw them together.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do, it is more than Miss Tucker
does,&#8221; said Appleton, &#8220;for I can&#8217;t flatter
myself that she suspects in the least what I
am about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t said anything yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mrs. Kennion, I&#8217;ve known
her less than a fortnight! It&#8217;s bad enough
for a man to fall in love in that absurd
length of time, but I wouldn&#8217;t ask a girl
to marry me on two weeks&#8217; acquaintance.
It would simply be courting refusal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you feel that way about it,
for we have grown greatly attached to Miss
Tucker,&#8221; said the bishop&#8217;s wife. &#8220;She is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
so simple and unaffected, so lovable, and
such good company! So alone in the world,
yet so courageous and independent. I
hope it will come out all right for your dear
mother&#8217;s son,&#8221; she added affectionately,
with a squeeze of her kind hand. &#8220;Miss
Tucker is dining here to-morrow, and you
must come, too, for she has offered to sing
for our friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody agreed that Mrs. Kennion&#8217;s
party for the young American singer was
a delightful and memorable occasion. She
gave them song after song, accompanying
herself on the Erard grand piano, at which
she always made such a pretty picture. It
drifted into a request programme, and
Tommy, whose memory was inexhaustible,
seemed always to have the wished-for song
at the tip of her tongue, were it English,
Scotch, Irish, or Welsh. There was general
laughter and surprise when Madame Eriksson,
a Norwegian lady who was among the
guests, asked her for a certain song of Halfdan
Kjerulf&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I only know it in its English translation,&#8221;
Tommy said, &#8220;and I haven&#8217;t sung
it for a year, but I think I remember it.
Forgive me if I halt in the words:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;I hardly know, my darling,</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>But there&#8217;s one song, my darling,</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Then first I loved you so!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Tommy had sung the song hundreds of
times in earlier years, and she had not the
slightest self-consciousness when she began
it; but just as she reached the last four
lines her eyes met Fergus Appleton&#8217;s. He
was seated in a far corner of the room,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
leaning eagerly forward, with one arm on the
back of a chair in front of him. She was
singing the words to the company, but if
ever a man was uttering and confirming
them it was Fergus Appleton at that moment.
The blindest woman could see, the
deafest could hear, the avowal.</p>
<p>Tommy caught her breath quickly, looked
away, braced her memory, and finished, to
the keen delight of old Madame Eriksson,
who rose and kissed her on both cheeks.</p>
<p>Tommy was glad that her part of the
evening was over, and to cover her confusion
offered to sing something of her
own composing, the Mother Goose rhyme
of &#8220;Little Tommy Tucker Sings for His
Supper,&#8221; arranged as an operatic recitative
and aria. The humor of this performance
penetrated even to the remotest fastnesses
of the staid cathedral circle, and the palace
party ended in something that positively
resembled merriment, a consummation not
always to be reached in gatherings exclusively
clerical in character.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>The bishop&#8217;s coachman always drove
Miss Tucker home, and Appleton always
walked to his lodgings, which were in the
opposite direction, so nothing could be
done that night, but he determined that
another sun should not go down before he
put his fate to the touch.</p>
<p>How could he foresee what the morning
post would bring and deposit, like an unwelcome
bomb, upon his breakfast tray?</p>
<p>His London publishers wanted to see him
at once, not only on a multitude of details
concerning his forthcoming book, but on a
subject, as they hoped, of great interest and
importance to him.</p>
<p>Thinking it a matter of a day or so,
Appleton scribbled notes to Mrs. Kennion
and Miss Tucker, with whom he was to go
on an excursion, and departed forthwith to
London.</p>
<p>Everything happened in London. The
American publishers wanted a different
title for the book and four more chapters
to lengthen it to a size selling (at a profit)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
for two dollars and a half. The English
publishers thought he had dealt rather
slightingly with a certain very interesting
period, and he remembered, guiltily, that
he had been at Bexley Sands when he wrote
the chapters in question. It would take
three days&#8217; labor to fill up these gaps, he
calculated, and how fortunate that Miss
Thomasina Tucker was safely entrenched in
the heart of an ecclesiastical stronghold for
the next month or two; a town where he
had not, so far as he knew, a single formidable
rival. He wrote her regarding his unexpected
engagements, adding with legitimate
pride that one of England&#8217;s foremost
critics had offered to write a preface for his
book; then he settled to his desk and slaved
at his task until it was accomplished, when
he departed with a beating heart for the
town and county that held Miss Thomasina
Tucker in their keeping.</p>
<p>Alighting at the familiar railway station,
he took a hansom, intending to drop his portmanteau
at his lodgings and go on to the palace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
for news, but as he was driving by the
deanery on the north side of Cathedral Green,
he encountered Mrs. Kennion in her victoria.
She signaled him with her hand and spoke
to her coachman, who drew up his horses.
Alighting from his hansom, he strode forward
to take her welcoming hand, his face radiating
the pleasure of a home-coming traveler.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll let the cabman take your luggage,
I&#8217;d like to drive you home myself. I
have something to tell you,&#8221; said Mrs.
Kennion, making room for him by her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing has happened, I hope?&#8221; he
asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Tucker is leaving for America
to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going away?&#8221; Appleton&#8217;s tone was one
of positive dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It is all very sudden and unexpected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sailing to-morrow?&#8221; exclaimed Appleton,
taking out his watch. &#8220;From where?
How can I get there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not sailing to-morrow&mdash;leaving Wells
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
to-morrow on an early train and sailing
Saturday from Southampton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the world is not lost entirely, then!&#8221;&mdash;and
Appleton leaned back and wiped his
forehead. &#8220;What has happened? I ought
never to have gone to London.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She had a cable yesterday from her
Brooklyn church, offering her a better
position in the choir, but saying that they
could hold it only ten days. By post on
the same day she received a letter from a
New York friend&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it a Carl Bothwick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; a Miss Macleod, who said that a
much better position was in the market in a
church where Miss Tucker had influential
friends. She was sure that if Miss Tucker
returned immediately to sing for the committee
she could secure a thousand-dollar
salary. We could do nothing but advise her
to make the effort, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she seem determined to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; she appeared a little undecided and
timid. However, she said frankly that,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
though she had earned enough in England
to pay her steamer passage to America, and
a month&#8217;s expenses afterward, she could
not be certain of continuing to do so much
through a London winter. &#8216;If I only had a
little more time to think it out,&#8217; she kept
saying, &#8216;but I haven&#8217;t, so I must go!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is she now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At her lodgings. The bishop is detained
in Bath and I am dining with friends
in his stead. I thought you might go and
take her to dinner at the Swan, so that she
shouldn&#8217;t be alone, and then bring her to
the palace afterward&mdash;if&mdash;if all is well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have any luck two churches will be
lamenting her loss to-morrow morning,&#8221;
said Fergus gloomily; &#8220;but she wouldn&#8217;t
have consented to go if she cared anything
about me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, my dear boy! You were
away. No self-respecting girl would wire
you to come back. She was helpless even
if she did care. Here we are! Shall I send
a hansom back in half an hour?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five minutes will do it,&#8221; Appleton
answered briskly. &#8220;You are an
angel, dear lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your blarney! I hope you&#8217;ll need
it all for somebody else to-night! Good
fortune, dear boy!&#8221;</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.4em;'>VIII</p>
</div>

<p>Appleton flung the contents of his portmanteau
into his closet, rid himself of the
dust of travel, made a quick change, and in
less than forty minutes was at the door of
Miss Tucker&#8217;s lodgings.</p>
<p>She had a little sitting-room on the first
floor, and his loud rat-a-tat brought her to
the door instead of the parlor-maid.</p>
<p>At the unexpected sight of him she turned
pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, I thought it was the luggage-man.
Where did you come from?&#8221;
she stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;From London, an hour ago. I met Mrs.
Kennion on my way from the station.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Then she told you I am going home?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she told me. How could you go
to America without saying good-bye, Miss
Tommy?&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed and looked perilously near
tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote to you this morning as soon as
I had decided,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to
dart off in this way, you can imagine, but
it&#8217;s a question of must.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not argue this with her; that was
a bridge to be crossed when a better understanding
had been reached; so, as if taking
the journey as an inexorable fact, he said:
&#8220;Come out and dine with me somewhere,
and let us have a good talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m eating now on a
tray in my sitting-room,&#8221;&mdash;and she waved
a table napkin she was holding in her hand.
&#8220;I am rather tired, and Miss Scattergood
gave me some bacon and an egg from the
nest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give the bacon to the cat and put back
the egg in the nest,&#8221; he said coaxingly.
&#8220;Mrs. Kennion said: &#8216;Don&#8217;t let her eat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
her last dinner alone. Take her to the
Swan.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am only in my traveling-clothes
and the Swan is full of strangers to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Green Dragon, then, near the cathedral.
You look dressed for Buckingham
Palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment, and then melted
at the eagerness of his wish. &#8220;Well, then,
if you&#8217;ll wait five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course; I&#8217;ll go along to the corner
and whistle a hansom from the stand.
Don&#8217;t hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>The mental processes of Miss Thomasina
Tucker had been very confused during
the excitement of the last twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>That she loved Fergus Appleton she was
well aware since the arrival of the cablegram
calling her back to America. Up to
that time she had fenced with her love&mdash;parried
it, pricked it, thrust it off, drawn
it back, telling herself that she had plenty
of time to meet the issue if it came. That
Fergus Appleton loved her she was also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
fairly well convinced, but that fact did not
always mean&mdash;everything&mdash;she told herself,
with a pitiful little attempt at worldly
wisdom. Perhaps he preferred his liberty
to any woman; perhaps he did not want to
settle down; perhaps he was engaged to
some one whom he didn&#8217;t care for now, but
would have to marry; perhaps he hadn&#8217;t
money enough to share with a wife; perhaps
he was a flirt&mdash;no, she would not
admit that for an instant. Anyway, she
was alone in the world, and the guardian of
her own dignity. If she could have allowed
matters to drift along in the heavenly uncertainty
of these last days, there would have
been no problem; but when she was forced
to wake from her delicious dream and fly
from everything that held her close and
warm, fly during Fergus Appleton&#8217;s absence,
without his knowledge or consent&mdash;that
indeed was heart-breaking. And still
her pride showed her but the one course.
She was alone in the world and without
means save those earned by her own exertions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
A living income was offered her in
America and she must take it or leave it on
the instant. She could not telegraph Fergus
Appleton in London and acquaint him with
her plans, as if they depended on him for
solution; she could only write him a warm
and friendly good-bye. If he loved her as
much as a man ought who loved at all, he
had time to follow her to Southampton before
her ship sailed. If business kept him
from such a hurried journey, he could ask
her to marry him in a sixpenny wire, reply
paid. If he neither came nor wired, but sent
a box of mignonette to the steamer with his
card and &#8220;Bon voyage&#8221; written on it, she
would bury something unspeakably dear and
precious that had only just been born&mdash;bury
it, and plant mignonette over it. And
she could always sing! Thank Heaven for the
gift of song!</p>
<p>This was Tommy&#8217;s mood when she was
packing her belongings, after hearing the
bishop say that Appleton could not return
till noon next day. It had changed a trifle by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
the time that Fergus had gone to the corner
to whistle for a hansom. Her gray frieze
jacket and skirt were right enough when she
hastily slipped on a better blouse with a deep
embroidered collar, pinned with Helena
Markham&#8217;s parting gift of an emerald clover-leaf.
Her gray straw hat had a becoming band
of flat green leaves, and she had a tinge of
color. (Nothing better for roses in the cheeks
than hurrying to be ready for the right man.)
Anyway, such beauty as Tommy had was
always there, and when she came to the
door she smote Appleton&#8217;s eyes as if she
were &#8220;the first beam from the springing
east.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once in the hansom, they talked gayly.
They dared not stop, indeed, for when they
kept on whipping the stream they forgot the
depth of the waters underneath.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Meantime the Green Dragon, competitor
of the Swan, had great need of their lavish
and interesting patronage.</p>
<p>The Swiss head waiter, who was new to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Wells, was a man of waxed mustaches and
sleepless ambitions. The other hotels had
most of the tourists, but he intended to
retrieve the fortunes of his employer, and
bring prosperity back to the side streets.
He adored his vocation, and would have
shed his heart&#8217;s blood on the altar of any
dining-room of which he had charge.</p>
<p>There were nine tables placed about the
large room, though not more than three had
been occupied in his tenure of office; but all
were beautifully set with flowers and bright
silver and napkins in complicated foldings.
Pasteboard cards with large black numbers
from one to eight stood erect on eight of the
tables, and on the ninth an imposing placard
bore the sign:</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>ENGAGED</p>
</div>

<p>in letters two inches high, giving the idea
that a hungry crowd was waiting to surge in
and take the seats.</p>
<p>The second man, trained within an inch
of his life, had been already kindled by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
enthusiasm of his superior, and shared his
vigils.</p>
<p>This very evening there had been hopes
deferred and sickened hearts over the indifference
of the public to a menu fit for a
king. Were there not consommé royale, filet
of sole, maître d&#8217;hôtel, poulet en casserole,
pommes de terres sautés, haricots verts, and
a wonderful Camembert? A savory could be
inserted in an instant, and a sweet arranged
in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;A carriage, Walter! Prepare!&#8221;</p>
<p>Both flew silently to the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two ladies; ah, they are not alighting!
They wish to know if there is evening service
in the cathedral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gentleman, Walter! In a four-wheeler!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he dines not. He has come to request
his umbrella of the porter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A hansom, Walter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, they alight. She is of an elegance
unmistakable. They are young married ones,
and will dine well. Hasten, Walter, and order
both sweet and savory!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>Fergus and Tommy looked about the cozy
room with pleasure as they entered, receiving
the salute of Gustave and the English
bow of Walter as tributes to their deep, unspoken
hopes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where will you sit, Miss Tucker?&#8221;
asked Appleton, and as he spoke his quick
eye observed the &#8220;Engaged&#8221; placard, and
with lightning dexterity he steered his guest
toward that table. (There <i>was</i> an opening,
if you like!) Not quick enough for Tommy,
though, for she had seen it and dropped into
a seat several feet away, declaring its position
was perfect. Gustave put menus before
his distinguished clients with a flourish, and
indicated the wine card as conspicuously as
was consistent with good form. Then he
paused and made mental notes of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, very good, very good,&#8221; murmured
Appleton. &#8220;You might move the flowers,
please; they rather hide&mdash;the view; and
bring the soup, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very young married ones!&#8221; thought Gustave,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
summoning his slave and retiring to a
point where he could watch the wine card.
Walter brought the consommé, and then
busied himself at the other tables. They
would never be occupied, but it was just as
well to pretend, so he set hideous colored
wine-glasses, red, green, and amber, at the
various places, and polished them ostentatiously
with a clean napkin in the hope that
the gentleman would experience a desire for
liquid refreshment.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very jolly, and very unexpected,&#8221;
said Appleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t miss the nest-egg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t call it a nest-egg! That&#8217;s
a stale thing, or a china one that they leave
in, I don&#8217;t know why&mdash;for an example, or a
pattern, or a suggestion,&#8221; said Tommy, laughing.
&#8220;An egg from the nest is Miss Scattergood&#8217;s
phrase, and it means a new-laid one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see!&mdash;well, do you regret it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not, with this sumptuous repast
just beginning!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You always give me an appetite,&#8221; exclaimed
Appleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a humble function, but not one to
be despised,&#8221; Tommy answered mischievously,
fencing, fencing every minute, with
her heart beating against her ribs like a
sledge-hammer.</p>
<p>Walter brought the fish and solicitously
freed the wine card that had somehow crept
under a cover of knives and forks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg ten thousand pardons. What will
you drink, Miss Tucker? We must have a
drop of something to cheer us at a farewell
dinner. Here is a vintage champagne, a good
honest wine that will hearten us up and
leave no headache in its train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t to-night, Mr. Appleton; I
really couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I refuse to be exhilarated alone,&#8221;
said Fergus gallantly; &#8220;and you always have
the effect of champagne on me anyway. I
decline to say good-bye. I can&#8217;t even believe
it is &#8216;au revoir&#8217; between us. We had such
delightful days ahead, and so many plans.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it isn&#8217;t nice to make up your mind
so suddenly that it turns everything topsy-turvy,&#8221;
sighed Tommy&mdash;&#8220;I won&#8217;t have
any meat, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walter looked distinctly grieved. &#8220;I can
recommend the pulley-ong-cazzerole, miss,
and there&#8217;s potatoes sortey with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tommy&#8217;s appetite kindled at the sound
of his accent, and she relented. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll
have a small portion, please, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When friends are together the world
seems very small, and when they are separated
it becomes a space too vast for human
comprehension&mdash;I think I&#8217;ve heard that
before, but it&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Appleton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Tommy answered, for lack of anything
better to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems as if we had known each other
for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it is less than three weeks,&#8221; was
Tommy&#8217;s contribution to the lagging conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bishop offered me a letter of introduction
to you when he wrote me at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
Bexley Sands Inn, you remember, but he
added in a postscript that in case of accident
he was not to be held responsible. Rather
cryptic, I thought&mdash;at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little Commonburg, sir?&#8221; asked Walter.
&#8220;It is a very fine ripe one, and we have
some fresh water-cress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Commonburg,&#8217; Miss Tucker? No? Then
bring the coffee, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>A desperate silence fell between them,
they who had talked unendingly for days
and evenings!</p>
<p>When Walter brought the tray with the
coffee-pot and the two little cups, Appleton
suddenly pushed his chair back, saying:
&#8220;Let us take our coffee over by the
window, shall we, and perhaps I may have
a cigarette later? Don&#8217;t light the gas,
waiter&mdash;we want to see the hills and the
afterglow.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no avoiding it; Appleton and
the waiter conveyed Tommy helplessly over
to a table commanding the view and the
sunset, and it was the one on which the huge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
&#8220;Engaged&#8221; placard reared itself persuasively
and suggestively.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall need nothing more, waiter; you
may go; I think this will cover the bill,&#8221;&mdash;and
scorning the chair opposite Tommy,
Appleton seated himself beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have turned your back to the afterglow,&#8221;
she said, as she reached forward to
move &#8220;Engaged&#8221; to a position a trifle less
obvious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care tuppence about the afterglow,&#8221;
and Appleton covered her hand with
his own. &#8220;Make it come true, dear, dear
Tommy! Make it come true!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she asked, between a smile and
a tear.</p>
<p>&#8220;The placard, dear, the placard! If you
should travel the world over, you couldn&#8217;t
find a man who loves you as I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would be the use in my traveling
about to find another man when I am so
satisfied with this one?&#8221; whispered Tommy.
&#8220;Oh, remember! they may come back at
any moment!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will, I will, if only I may have the comfort
of holding your hand after all my miserable
doubts! I never knew what companionship
meant before I met you! I never really
cared about life until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always cared about it, but never
like this,&#8221; confessed Tommy. &#8220;You see, I
have always been alone, ever since I grew up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I! How wonderful of Fate to bring
us together! And will you let me cable to the
churches that you cannot come home just
yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;d better not go&mdash;so soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without me? Never! You shall go anywhere
you like, any time you like, so long as
you take me with you. We&#8217;ll settle all those
things to-morrow&mdash;the blessedest day that
ever dawned, that&#8217;s what to-morrow will
be! Couldn&#8217;t you marry me to-morrow,
Tommy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not! At any rate&mdash;not in the
morning!&#8221; said Tommy mischievously, withdrawing
her hand and moving out of the
danger zone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you must remember that your
talent is your own, to use as you like!&#8221; Appleton
continued after a well-filled pause.
&#8220;Your voice is a unique and precious gift.
I&#8217;ll try not to be selfish with it, or jealous of
it, though if it had half the effect on other
men that it has upon me, the floor would be
strewn with broken hearts every time you
sing!&#8221;&mdash;and he hummed under his breath:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;I hardly know, my darling,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>What mostly took my heart,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Unless perhaps your singing</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Has done the greater part.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you dear absurdity!&#8221; said Tommy,
twinkling and sparkling enchantingly.&mdash;&#8220;I
wish the waiter wouldn&#8217;t come in every
time I want to say something especially
private!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Confound his politics, frustrate his
knavish tricks,&#8217; but we shall soon be out of
his reach, spinning along to the palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going there? Oh! I shall be afraid
to tell the bishop and Mrs. Kennion!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be. I told Mrs. Kennion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
this afternoon that I loved you to distraction.
If the bishop is back from Bath, she&#8217;ll
have passed on the information by now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just going to say, when the waiter
came so near, that it isn&#8217;t the public I love,
it&#8217;s the singing! Just to sing and sing, that&#8217;s
what I long to do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what you shall do, so help me! You
know you wanted me to find a new name for
you? Wasn&#8217;t I clever to think of Appleton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very! And you&#8217;re kindly freeing me of
half of my &#8216;bizarre Americanism,&#8217; as my
Torquay correspondent called it. How shall
we deal with Thomasina?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll call her Tommy. A darling, kissable
little name, Tommy!&mdash;No, I&#8217;m not
going to do anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s cowardly of me to
marry you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cowardly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when I haven&#8217;t actually proved
that I can earn my living; at least, I haven&#8217;t
done it long enough, or well enough, yet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s brave of you to marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To turn your back on a possible career.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the &#8216;careering&#8217; that I love;
though it will seem very strange when
Tommy Tucker doesn&#8217;t have to sing for
her supper!&mdash;Shall we go? The waiter is
coming in again. I believe he thinks we are
going to run off with the spoons!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we are! At least, when we go, the
spoons will go! I know it&#8217;s a poor joke, but
I am too happy to be brilliant. Call the head
waiter, please,&#8221;&mdash;this to Walter, who despaired
of ever getting rid of his guests, and
was agreeably disappointed that a gentleman
who had not ordered wine should ask for
Gustave.</p>
<p>Appleton took the &#8220;Engaged&#8221; placard off
the table and used it nonchalantly as a fan
in crossing the room. Then as he drew near
the men he slipped two gold pieces into
Tommy&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I carry away this placard, waiter?&#8221;
he asked, as if it were quite a sane request.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken a fancy to it as a souvenir of a
most delightful and memorable dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Assuredly, assuredly!&#8221; murmured Gustave.
He knew that there was romance in the
air, although he did not perceive the exact
point of Appleton&#8217;s request.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young lady will reward you for
your courtesy. No; I&#8217;ll help with her jacket,
thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tommy, overcome with laughter and confusion
and blushes, pressed the gold pieces
into the hands of the astonished waiters, who
bowed almost to the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are always giving me sovereigns,
dear Fergus,&#8221; she whispered with a laugh
and something like a sob, as they drove
along in the delicious nearness provided by
the hansom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Fergus. &#8220;You will
be giving me one when you marry me!&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
<h2>THE TURNING-POINT</h2>
</div>

<p>Not far from the village of Bonny Eagle,
on the west bank of the Saco, stood two
little low-roofed farmhouses; the only two
that had survived among others of the same
kind that once dotted the green brink of the
river.</p>
<p>Long years before, in 1795 or thereabouts,
there had been a cluster of log
houses on this very spot, known then as the
Dalton Right Settlement, and these in turn
had been succeeded at a later date by the
more comfortable frame-roof farmhouses of
the period.</p>
<p>In the old days, before the sound of the
axe for the first time disturbed the stillness
of the forest, the otter swam in the shadowy
coves near the shore and the beaver built
his huts near by. The red deer came down to
dip his antlers and cool his flanks in the still
shallows. The speckled grouse sat on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
nest in the low pine boughs, while her mate
perched on the mossy logs by the riverside
unmolested.</p>
<p>The Sokokis built their bark wigwams
here and there on the bank, paddling their
birch canoes over the river&#8217;s smooth surface,
or threading the foamy torrents farther
down its course.</p>
<p>Here was the wonderful spring that fed,
and still feeds, Aunt Judy&#8217;s Brook, the most
turbulent little stream in the county. Many
a moccasin track has been made in the
soft earth around the never-failing fountain,
and many the wooden bucket lowered into
its crystal depths by the Dalton Righters
when in their turn they possessed the land.</p>
<p>The day of the Indian was over now, and
the day of the farmer who succeeded him
was over, too. The crash of the loom and
the whir of the spinning-wheel were heard
no longer, but Amanda Dalton, spinster,&mdash;descendant
of the original Tristram Dalton,
to whom the claim belonged,&mdash;sat on alone
in her house, and not far away sat Caleb
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
Kimball, sole living heir of the original Caleb,
himself a Dalton Righter, and contemporary
of Tristram Dalton.</p>
<p>Neither of these personages took any interest
in pedigree or genealogy. They knew
that their ancestors had lived and died on the
same acres now possessed by them, but the
acres had dwindled sadly, and the ancestors
had seemingly left little for which to be
grateful. Indeed, in Caleb&#8217;s case they had
been a distinct disadvantage, since the local
sense of humor, proverbially strong in York
County, had always preserved a set of Kimball
stories among its most cherished possessions.
Some of them might have been forgotten
in the century and a half that had
elapsed, if the Caleb of our story had not
been the inheritor of certain family traits
famous in their day and generation.</p>
<p>Caleb the first had been the &#8220;cuss&#8221; of
his fellow farmers, because in coming from
Scarboro to join the Dalton Righters he had
brought whiteweed with the bundle of hay
for his cattle when he was clearing the land.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
The soil of this particular region must have
been especially greedy for, and adapted to,
this obnoxious grass-killer, for it flourished as
in no other part of the county; flourishes
yet, indeed&mdash;though, if one can forget
that its presence means poor feed for cattle
where might be a crop of juicy hay, the
blossoming fields of the old Dalton Settlement
look, in early June, the loveliest, most
ethereal, in New England. There, a million
million feathery daisies sway and dance in
the breeze, lifting their snowy wheels to the
blue June sky. There they grow and thrive,
the slender green stalks tossing their pearly
disks among sister groves of buttercups till
the eye is fairly dazzled with the symphony
of white and gold. The back-aching farmers
of the original Dalton Settlement had
indeed tried to root out the lovely pests, but
little did our Caleb care! If he had ever trod
his ancestral acres either for pleasure or
profit he might in time have &#8220;stomped out&#8221;
the whiteweed, so the neighbors said, for he
had the family foot, the size of an anvil; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
he much preferred a sedentary life, and the
whiteweed went on seeding itself from year
to year.</p>
<p>Caleb was tall, loose-jointed, and black
as a thunder-cloud&mdash;the swarthy skin, like
the big foot, having been bequeathed to him
by the original Caleb, whose long-legged,
shaggy-haired sons had been known as
&#8220;Caleb&#8217;s colts.&#8221; Tall and black, all of them,
the &#8220;colts,&#8221; so black that the village wits
said the Kimball children must have eaten
smut and soot and drunk cinder tea during
the years their parents were clearing the
land. Tall and black also were all the Kimball
daughters, so tall it was their boast to
be able to look out over the tops of the window
curtains; and proud enough of their
height to cry with rage when any rival Amazon
came into the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Whatever else they were or were not, however,
the Kimballs had always been industrious
and frugal. It had remained for the
last scion of the old stock to furnish a byword
for slackness. In a village where stories
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
of outlandish, ungodly, or supernatural
laziness were sacredly preserved from year
to year, Caleb Kimball&#8217;s indolence easily
took the palm. His hay commonly went to
seed in the field. His cow yielded her morning&#8217;s
milk about noon, and her evening
&#8220;mess&#8221; was taken from her (when she was
lucky) by the light of a lantern. He was a
bachelor of forty-five, dwelt alone, had no
visitors and made his living, such as it was,
off the farm, with the help of a rack-o&#8217;-bones
horse. He had fifty acres of timber-land, and
when his easy-going methods of farming
found him without money he simply sold a
few trees.</p>
<p>The house and barn were gradually falling
into ruins; the farm implements stood in the
yard all winter, and the sleigh all summer.
The gate flapped on its hinges, the fences
were broken down, and the stone walls were
full of gaps. His pipe, and a snarling rough-haired
dog, were his only companions. Hour
after hour he sat on the side steps looking
across the sloping meadows that separated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
his place from Amanda Dalton&#8217;s; hour after
hour he puffed his pipe and gazed on the
distant hills and the sparkling river; gazed
and gazed&mdash;whether he saw anything or
thought anything, remembered anything, or
even dreamed anything, nobody could guess,
not even Amanda Dalton, who was good
at guessing, having very few other mental
recreations to keep her mother-wit alive.</p>
<p>Caleb Kimball, as seen on his doorstep
from Amanda Dalton&#8217;s sink window, was
but a speck, to be sure, but he was her nearest
neighbor; if a person whose threshold
you never cross, and who never crosses
yours, can be called a neighbor. There were
seldom or never meetings or greetings between
the two, yet each unconsciously was
very much alive to the existence of the other.
In days or evenings of solitude one can make
neighbors of very curious things.</p>
<p>The smoke of Amanda&#8217;s morning fire
cried &#8220;Shame&#8221; to Caleb&#8217;s when it issued
languidly from his kitchen chimney an hour
later. Amanda&#8217;s smoke was like herself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
and betokened the brisk fire she would be
likely to build; Caleb&#8217;s showed wet wood,
poor draught, a fallen brick in the chimney.</p>
<p>Later on in the morning Caleb&#8217;s dog would
sometimes saunter down the road and have a
brief conversation with Amanda&#8217;s cat. They
were neither friends nor enemies, but merely
enlivened a deadly, dull existence with a few
casual remarks on current topics.</p>
<p>Once Caleb had possessed a flock of hens,
but in the course of a few years they had
dwindled to one lonely rooster, who stalked
gloomily through the wilderness of misplaced
objects in the Kimball yard, and
wondered why he had been born.</p>
<p>Amanda pitied him, and flung him a
surreptitious handful of corn from her apron
pocket when she met him walking dejectedly
in the road halfway between the two houses.
So encouraged he extended his rambles, and
one afternoon Amanda, looking out of her
window, saw him stop at her gate and hold
a tête-à-tête with one of her Plymouth Rock
hens. The interview was brief but effective.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
In a twinkling he had told her of his miserable
life and his abject need of sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are times,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when, I give
you my word, I would rather be stewed for
dinner than lead my present existence! It
is weak for me to trouble you with my difficulties,
but you have always understood me
from the first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say no more,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I am a
woman and pity is akin to love. The fowls
of Amanda Dalton&#8217;s flock do not need me
as you do. Eleven eggs a day are laid here
regularly, and I will go where my egg will be
a daily source of pleasure and profit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The coop is draughty and the corn
scarce,&#8221; confessed the rooster, doing his best
to be noble.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am of the sex created especially to
supply companionship,&#8221; returned the hen,
&#8220;therefore I will accompany you, regardless
of personal inconvenience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amanda saw the departure of the eloping
couple and pursued them not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land sakes!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;if any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
male thing hereabouts has sprawl enough
to go courtin&#8217; I&#8217;m willin&#8217; to encourage &#8217;em.
She&#8217;ll miss her clean house and good food, I
guess, but I ain&#8217;t sure. She&#8217;s &#8216;women-folks&#8217;
after all, and I shouldn&#8217;t wonder a mite but
she&#8217;d take real comfort in makin&#8217; things
pleasanter up there for that pindlin&#8217;, God-forsaken
old rooster! She&#8217;ll have her hands
full, but there, I know what &#8217;tis to get
along with empty ones!&#8221;</p>
<p>There were not many such romances or
comedies as these to enliven Amanda&#8217;s
mornings. Then afternoon would slip into
twilight, darkness would creep over the
landscape, and Amanda&#8217;s light&mdash;clear,
steady, bright, serene&mdash;would gleam from
its place on the sink shelf through the kitchen
window, over the meadow, &#8220;up to Kimball&#8217;s.&#8221;
It was such a light as would stream
from a well-trimmed lamp with a crystal
clean chimney, but it met with small response
from its neighbor&#8217;s light during many
months of the year. In late autumn and winter
there would be a fugitive candle gleam upstairs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
in the Kimball house, and on stormy
evenings a dull, smoky light in the living-room.</p>
<p>From the illumination in the Dalton sink
window, Caleb thought Amanda sat in the
kitchen evenings, but she didn&#8217;t. She said
she kept the second light there because she
could afford it, and because the cat liked it.
The cat enjoyed the black haircloth sofa in
the sitting-room, afternoons, but she greatly
preferred the kitchen for evening use; it
made a change, and the high-backed cushioned
rocker was then vacant. Amanda had
nobody to consider but the cat, so she naturally
deferred to her in every possible
way. It was bad for the cat&#8217;s character, but
at least it kept Amanda from committing
suicide, so what would you? Here was a
woman of insistent, unflagging, unending
activity. Amanda Dalton had energy enough
to attend to a husband and six children&mdash;cook,
wash, iron, churn, sew, nurse&mdash;and
she lived alone with a cat. The village was
a mile, and her nearest female neighbor, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
Widow Thatcher, a half-mile away. She had
buried her only sister in Lewiston years before,
and she had not a relation in the world.
All her irrepressible zeal went into the conduct
of her house and plot of ground. Day
after day, week after week, year after year,
the established routine was carried through.
First the washing of the breakfast dishes
and the putting to rights of the kitchen,
which was radiantly clean before she began
upon it. Next her bedroom; the stirring-up
of the cornhusk mattress, the shaking of
the bed of live geese feathers, the replacing
of cotton sheets, homespun blankets, and
blue-and-white counterpane. Next came the
sitting-room with its tall, red, flag-bottomed
chairs, its two-leaved table, its light stand
that held the Bible and work-basket and
lamp. The chest of drawers and tall clock
were piously dusted, and the frames of the
Family Register, &#8220;Napoleon Crossing the
Alps,&#8221; and &#8220;Maidens Welcoming Washington
in the Streets of Alexandria,&#8221; were
carefully wiped off. Once a week the parlor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
was cleaned, the tarlatan was lifted from the
two plaster Samuels on the mantelpiece,
their kneeling forms were cleaned with a
damp cloth, the tarlatan replaced, and the
parlor closed again reverently. There was
kindling to chop, wood to bring in, the
modest cooking, washing, ironing, and sewing
to do, the flower-beds to weed, and the
little vegetable garden to keep in order.</p>
<p>But Amanda had a quick foot, a neat
hand, a light touch, and a peculiar faculty
of &#8220;turning off&#8221; work so that it simply would
not last through the day. Why did she
never think of going to the nearest city and
linking her powers with those of some one
who would put them to larger uses? Simply
because no one ever did that sort of thing
in Bonny Eagle in those days. Girls crowded
out of home by poverty sought employment
here and there, but that a woman of forty,
with a good home and ten acres of land&mdash;to
say nothing of coupon bonds that yielded
a hundred dollars a year in cash&mdash;that such
a one should seek a larger field in a strange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
place, would have been thought flying in the
face of Providence, as well as custom.</p>
<p>Outside Bonny Eagle, in the roar and din
and clamor of cities, were all sorts of wrongs
that needed righting, wounds that cried out
to be healed. There were motherless children,
there were helpless sufferers moaning
for the sight of a green field, but the superfluous
females of Amanda Dalton&#8217;s day had
not awakened to any sense of responsibility
with regard to their unknown brothers and
sisters.</p>
<p>Amanda was a large-hearted woman. She
would have shared her soda biscuit, her bean
soup, her dandelion greens, her hogshead
cheese, her boiled dinner, her custard pie,
with any hungry mortal, but no one in
Bonny Eagle needed bite nor sup. Therefore
she feather-stitched her dish-towels, piled
her kindling in a &#8220;wheel pattern&#8221; in the
shed, named her hens and made friends of
them, put fourteen tucks in her unbleached
cotton petticoats, and fried a pancake every
Saturday for her cat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s either that or blow your brains out,
if you&#8217;ve got a busy mind!&#8221; she said grimly
to Susan Benson, her best friend, who was
passing a Saturday afternoon with her. It
was chilly and they liked the cheerful
warmth of the Saturday fire that was baking
the beans and steaming the brown bread.</p>
<p>Susan unrolled her patchwork and, giving
a flip to the cat with her thimble finger,
settled herself comfortably in the kitchen
rocker.</p>
<p>The cat leaped down and stalked into the
next room with an air of offended majesty,
as much as to say: &#8220;Of all the manners I
ever saw, that woman has the worst! She
contrives to pass by three empty chairs and
choose the one I chance to be occupying!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be so lonesome if you
could see a bit of life from your house,
Mandy,&#8221; said Mrs. Benson. &#8220;William an&#8217;
I were sayin&#8217; last night you&#8217;d ought to
move into the village winters, though nothin&#8217;
could be handsomer than the view from
your sink window this minute. Daisies,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
daisies everywhere! How do you manage
to keep &#8217;em out o&#8217; your place, Mandy, when
they&#8217;re so thick on Caleb Kimball&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just root an&#8217; root, an&#8217; keep on rootin&#8217;,&#8221;
Amanda responded cheerfully, &#8220;though I
don&#8217;t take a mite o&#8217; pride out of it, for the
better my place looks the worse his does, by
comparison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a sight!&#8221; said Mrs. Benson, standing
for a moment by the sink and looking up
to Kimball&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went up there one night after dark,
when I knew Caleb &#8217;d gone to Hixam, an&#8217; I
patched up some o&#8217; the holes in his stone
wall, thinkin&#8217; his whiteweed seeds wouldn&#8217;t
blow through quite so thick!&#8221;&mdash;and
Amanda joined Mrs. Benson at the window.
&#8220;I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; done a day&#8217;s work on his side o&#8217; the
wall as lief as not, only I knew folks would
talk if they saw me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Land, no, they wouldn&#8217;t, Mandy. Everybody
knows you wouldn&#8217;t take him if
he was the last man on earth; an&#8217; as for
Caleb, I guess he wouldn&#8217;t marry any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
woman above ground, not if she was a
seraphim. I used to think he&#8217;d spunk up
some time or other, when he got over his
mother&#8217;s death; but it&#8217;s too late now, I&#8217;m
afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Caleb set great store by his mother;
that&#8217;s one good thing about him,&#8221; said
Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did for certain,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Benson.
&#8220;If that girl he was engaged to hadn&#8217;t
&#8217;a&#8217; spoken disrespectful to her in his hearin&#8217;
there&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been a wife an&#8217; children up there
now an&#8217; the place would &#8217;a&#8217; looked diff&#8217;rent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so very diff&#8217;rent! He didn&#8217;t lose
much in Eliza Johnson. I guess he knows
that by now!&#8221; remarked Amanda serenely;
&#8220;though I s&#8217;pose &#8217;t was quarrelin&#8217; with her
that set him runnin&#8217; down hill, all the
same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought he cared anything about
Eliza. She was determined to have him, an&#8217;
he was too lazy to say no, but you see in the
end she only got her labor for her pains.
The Kimball boys never had any luck with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
their love affairs. When Caleb an&#8217; his mother
was left alone, she was terrible anxious for
him to marry. She was allers findin&#8217; girls for
him, but part of &#8217;em wouldn&#8217;t look at him,
and he wouldn&#8217;t make up to any of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was livin&#8217; in Lewiston those years,&#8221;
said Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember you was. Well, when old
Mrs. Kimball broke her arm, Charles, the
youngest son, that was a stage-driver, determined
he&#8217;d get somebody for Caleb, for
his own wife wouldn&#8217;t lift her finger to help
&#8217;bout the house. He saw a girl up to Steep
Falls that he kind o&#8217; liked the looks of, an&#8217;
he offered her a ride down to his mother&#8217;s
to spend the day, thinkin&#8217; if the family liked
her she might do for Caleb. However, her
eyes was weak an&#8217; she didn&#8217;t know how to
milk, so they thought she&#8217;d better go home
by train. That would &#8217;a&#8217; been fair enough
for both parties, but when Charles drove her
to the station he charged her fifteen cents an&#8217;
it made an awful sight o&#8217; talk. She had a hot
temper, an&#8217; she kind o&#8217; resented it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say &#8217;t wa&#8217;n&#8217;t so,&#8221; commented
Amanda; &#8220;but everybody&#8217;s dead that could
deny it, except Caleb, and he wouldn&#8217;t
take the trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the days when he&#8217;s real drove,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Susan sarcastically, as she
looked across the field to the wood-pile
where a gray-shirted figure sat motionless.
&#8220;If ever a man needed a wife to patch the
seat of his pants, it&#8217;s Caleb Kimball! I guess
it&#8217;s the only part of his clothes he ever
wears out. He wa&#8217;n&#8217;t like that before his
mother died; the wheels seemed to stop in
him then an&#8217; there. He was queer an&#8217; strange
an&#8217; shy, but I never used to think he&#8217;d
develop into a reg&#8217;lar hermit. She&#8217;d turn in
her grave, Mis&#8217; Kimball would, to see him
look as he does. I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose he gets any
proper nourishment. The smartest man in
the world won&#8217;t take the trouble to make
pie for himself, yet he&#8217;ll eat it &#8217;s long &#8217;s he
can stan&#8217; up! Caleb&#8217;s mother was a great
pie-baker. I can see her now, shovelin&#8217; &#8217;em
in an&#8217; out o&#8217; the oven Saturdays, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
her three great black lanky boys standin&#8217;
roun&#8217; waitin&#8217; for &#8217;em to cool off.&mdash;&#8216;Only
<i>one</i>, mother?&#8217; Caleb used to say, kind o&#8217;
wheedlin&#8217;ly, while she laughed up at him
leanin&#8217; against the door-frame.&mdash;&#8216;What&#8217;s
one blueb&#8217;ry pie amongst me?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must &#8217;a&#8217; had some fun in him once,&#8221;
smiled Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say women-folks ain&#8217;t got no sense
o&#8217; humor,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Benson, with a
twitch of her thread. &#8220;I notice the men that
live <i>without</i> &#8217;em don&#8217;t seem to have any! We
may not amount to much, but we&#8217;re somethin&#8217;
to laugh <i>at</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you bake him a pie now
an&#8217; then, an&#8217; send it up, Susan?&#8221; asked
Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there, I don&#8217;t feel I hardly know
him well enough, though William does. I
dare say he wouldn&#8217;t like it, an&#8217; he&#8217;d never
think to return the plate, so far away.&mdash;Besides,
there never <i>is</i> an extry pie in a
house where there&#8217;s a man an&#8217; three boys;
which reminds me I&#8217;ve got to go home an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
make one for breakfast, with nothin&#8217; to
make it out of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could lend you a handful o&#8217; dried
plums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; I&#8217;ll take &#8217;em an&#8217; much
obliged. I declare it seems to me, now the
rhubarb&#8217;s &#8217;bout gone, as if the apples on the
trees never would fill out enough to drop
off. There does come a time in the early
summer, after you&#8217;re sick of mince, &#8217;n&#8217;
squash, &#8217;n&#8217; punkin, &#8217;n&#8217; cranberry, &#8217;n&#8217; rhubarb,
&#8217;n&#8217; custard, &#8217;n&#8217; &#8217;t ain&#8217;t time for currant,
or green apple, or strawb&#8217;ry, or
raspb&#8217;ry, or blackb&#8217;ry&mdash;there does come a
time when it seems as if Providence might
&#8217;a&#8217; had a little more ingenuity in plannin&#8217;
pie-fillin&#8217;!&mdash;You might bake a pie for
Caleb now an&#8217; then yourself, Mandy; you&#8217;re
so near.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Thatcher lives half a mile away,&#8221;
replied Amanda; &#8220;but I couldn&#8217;t carry
Caleb Kimball a pie without her knowin&#8217; it
an&#8217; makin&#8217; remarks. I&#8217;d bake one an&#8217; willin&#8217;
if William &#8217;d take it to him; but there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
&#8217;t would only make him want another. He&#8217;s
made his bed an&#8217; he&#8217;s got to lie on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>lays</i> on his bed sure enough, an&#8217; most
o&#8217; the time probably&mdash;but do you believe
he ever makes it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Amanda shuddered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Susan;
it&#8217;s one o&#8217; the things that haunts me;
whether he makes it or whether he don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you ever see any wash hung out?&#8221;
Mrs. Benson&#8217;s needle stopped in midair
while she waited for Amanda&#8217;s answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es; now an&#8217; then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheets; once a gray blanket; underclothes;
but naturally I don&#8217;t look when
they&#8217;re hung out. He generally puts &#8217;em
on the grass, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a sin for a man to live so in a
Christian country, an&#8217; the kindest thing to
say about him is that he&#8217;s crazy. Some o&#8217;
the men folks over to the store declare he is
crazy; but William declares he ain&#8217;t. He
says he&#8217;s asleep. William kind o&#8217; likes him.
Does he ever pass the time o&#8217; day with you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly ever. I meet him once or twice
a year, maybe, in the road. He bows when
I go past on an errand an&#8217; holds on to his
dog when he tries to run out an&#8217; bite me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s real kind o&#8217; gentlemanly,&#8221; observed
Susan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of it that way,&#8221; said
Amanda absently; &#8220;but perhaps it is. All I
can say is, Caleb Kimball&#8217;s a regular thorn
in my flesh. I can&#8217;t do anything for him, an&#8217;
I can&#8217;t forget him, right under foot as he
is&mdash;his land joinin&#8217; mine. Mornin&#8217;, noon,
an&#8217; night for years I&#8217;ve wanted to get into
that man&#8217;s house an&#8217; make it decent for him;
wanted to milk the cow the right time o&#8217; day;
feed the horse; weed the garden; scrub the
floor; wash the windows; black the stove.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How you do go on, Mandy!&#8221; exclaimed
Mrs. Benson. &#8220;What diff&#8217;rence does it make
to you how dirty he is, so long&#8217;s you&#8217;re
clean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does make a diff&#8217;rence, an&#8217; it always
will. I hate to see the daisies growin&#8217; so
thick, knowin&#8217; how he needs hay. I want to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
root &#8217;em out same&#8217;s I did mine, after I&#8217;d
been away three years in Lewiston. I hate
to take my pot o&#8217; beans out o&#8217; the oven
Saturday nights an&#8217; know he ain&#8217;t had
gumption enough to get himself a Christian
meal. Livin&#8217; alone &#8217;s I do, Susan, things
&#8216;bulk up&#8217; in my mind bigger&#8217;n they&#8217;d
ought to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They do so,&#8221; agreed Susan; &#8220;an&#8217; you
mustn&#8217;t let &#8217;em. You must come over to
our house oftener. You know William loves
to have you, an&#8217; so do the boys. The Bible
may insinuate we are our brother&#8217;s keeper,
but we can&#8217;t none of us help it if he won&#8217;t
<i>be</i> kept!&mdash;There, I must be gettin&#8217; home.
I&#8217;ve had considerable many reminders the
last half-hour that it&#8217;s about time! It&#8217;s none
o&#8217; my business, Mandy, but you do spoil that
cat, an&#8217; the time&#8217;s not far off when he won&#8217;t
be a mite o&#8217; comfort to you. Of course, I&#8217;m
too intimate here to take offense, but if the
minister should happen to set in this chair
when he calls, an&#8217; see that cat promenade
round an&#8217; round the rockers an&#8217; then rustle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
off into the settin&#8217;-room as mad as Cuffy,
he&#8217;d certainly take notice an&#8217; think he
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t a welcome visitor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like mistress, like cat!&#8221; sighed Amanda.
&#8220;Tristram an&#8217; I get awful set in our ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind o&#8217; queer, Mandy, namin&#8217; a cat for
your grandfather,&#8221; Mrs. Benson observed
anxiously as she opened the door. &#8220;William
an&#8217; me don&#8217;t want you to get queer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got anything better &#8217;n a cat to
name for grandfather,&#8221; said poor Amanda,
in a tone that set her friend Susan thinking
as she walked homeward.</p>
<p>The summer wore along and there came
a certain Tuesday different from all the
other Tuesdays in that year, or in all the
forty years that had gone before&mdash;a Tuesday
when the Kimball side door was not
opened in the morning. No smoke issued
from the chimney all day. The rooster and
his kidnapped hen flew up from the steps
and pecked at the door panels vigorously.
Seven o&#8217;clock in the evening came, then eight,
and no light to be seen anywhere. The dog
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
howled; the horse neighed; the cow lowed
ominously in the closed barn. At nine o&#8217;clock
Amanda took a lantern and sped across the
field, found a pail in the shed, slipped into the
barn, milked the cow, gave the beasts hay
and water, and leaving the pail of milk on the
steps, went quietly home again, anxious
lest she had done too much, anxious also
lest she had not done enough.</p>
<p>Next morning she stationed herself at her
kitchen window and took account of her
signs. The milk-pail was overturned on the
steps, the rooster and hen perching on the
rim, but there was no smoke coming from
the chimney. She thought quickly as she
did everything else. She waited long enough
to make a cup of coffee, then she slipped out
of her door and up to Kimball&#8217;s. Her apron
was full of kindling, and on her arm she
carried a basket with a package of herbs, a
tiny bottle of brandy, one of cologne, some
arrowroot and matches, a cake of hard soap
and a clean towel, bones for the dog and
corn for the hen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>Caleb&#8217;s door was unlocked. The dog
came out of the shed evincing no desire to
bark or bite. The kitchen was empty, and&mdash;she
thanked the Lord silently, as she
gave a hasty glance about&mdash;not as dreadful
as she had anticipated. Untidy beyond
words, bare, dreary, cheerless, but not
repulsively dirty. She stole softly through
the lower part of the house, and then with
a beating heart went up the uncarpeted
stairs. At the head was an open door that
showed her all she expected and feared to
find. The sun streamed in at the dusty, uncurtained
window over the motionless body
of Caleb Kimball, who lay in a strange, deep
sleep, unconscious, on the bed. His hair was
raven black against the pillow and the lashes
on his cheeks looked more &#8217;n a yard long,
Amanda told Susan Benson. (She afterward
confessed that this was a slight exaggeration
due to extreme excitement.) She spoke
his name three times, but he did not stir.
She must get the doctor and send for William
Benson, that was clear; but first she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
must try her hand at improving the immediate
situation.</p>
<p>Stealing downstairs she tied on her apron
and lighted a fire in the kitchen stove, with
the view of making things respectable before
gossipy neighbors came in. Her sister
used to say that the minute Amanda tied
on her apron things began to move and take
a turn for the better, and it was so now. She
poured a few drops of cologne into a basin
of water, and putting the towel over her arm
went upstairs to Caleb&#8217;s bedside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done him wrong,&#8221; she thought remorsefully
as she noted his decent night-clothing
and bedding. &#8220;He ain&#8217;t lost his
self-respect in all these years, and every soul
in Bonny Eagle thought he was living like
an animal!&#8221;</p>
<p>She bathed his face and throat and hands,
then moistened and smoothed his hair without
provoking a movement or a sound. He
seemed in a profound stupor, but there was
no stertorous breathing. Straightening the
bedclothes and giving a hasty wipe to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
tops of the pine bureau and table, she opened
the window and closed the blinds. At this
moment she spied one of the Thatcher boys
going along the road, and ran down to the
gate to ask him to send William Benson and
the doctor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell them Miss Dalton says please to
come quick; Caleb Kimball&#8217;s very sick,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you need mother, too?&#8221; asked
the boy. &#8220;She&#8217;s wanted to git into his house
for years, and she&#8217;d do most anything for the
chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Amanda pitilessly.
&#8220;I can do everything for the present, and
Mr. Benson will probably want his wife, if
anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the boy as he started
off on a dog-trot. News was rare in Bonny
Eagle, and Caleb Kimball was a distinguished
and interesting figure in village gossip.</p>
<p>Amanda Dalton had never had to hurry
in her life. That was one of her crosses, for
there probably never was a woman who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
could do more in less time. It was an hour
and a half before William Benson came,
and in those ninety minutes she had swept
the kitchen and poured a pail or two of hot
soap-suds over the floor, that may have
felt a mop, but certainly had not known a
scrubbing-brush for years. She tore down the
fly-specked, tattered, buff shades, and washed
the three windows; blackened the stove;
fed the dog and horse; milked the cow;
strained the milk and carried it down cellar;
making three trips upstairs in the meantime
to find no change in the patient. His lids
stayed down as though they were weighted
with lead, his long arms lay motionless on
the counterpane.</p>
<p>Amanda&#8217;s blood coursed through her
veins like lightning. Here was work to her
hand; blessed, healing work for days, perhaps
weeks to come. In these first moments
of emotional excitement I fear she hoped it
would be a long case of helpless invalidism,
during which it would be her Christian
duty to clean the lower part of the house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
and perhaps make some impression on the
shed; but this tempting thought was quickly
banished as she reflected that Caleb Kimball
was a bachelor, and the Widow Thatcher
the person marked out by a just but unsympathetic
Providence for sick-nurse and housekeeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;She shan&#8217;t come!&#8221; thought Amanda
passionately. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make the doctor ask me
to take charge. William Benson shall stay
here nights an&#8217; Susan will run in now an&#8217;
then daytimes, or I&#8217;ll get little Abby Thatcher
to do the rough work an&#8217; keep me company;
then her mother won&#8217;t make talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly what&#8217;s the matter
with the man,&#8221; confessed the doctor, when
he came. &#8220;There&#8217;s a mark and a swelling on
the back of his head as if he might have
fallen somewhere. He hasn&#8217;t got any pulse
and he&#8217;s all skin and bone. He&#8217;s starved out,
I guess, and his machinery has just stopped.
He wants nursing and feeding and all the
things a woman can do for him. The Lord
never intended men-folks to live alone!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If they ain&#8217;t got wit enough to find that
out for themselves it ain&#8217;t likely any woman&#8217;ll
take the trouble to tell &#8217;em!&#8221; exclaimed
Amanda with some spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get stuffy, Amanda! Just be a
good Christian and take hold here for a few
days till we see whether we&#8217;ve got to have
a nurse from Portland. Man&#8217;s extremity is
God&#8217;s opportunity; maybe Caleb&#8217;ll come
to his senses before he gets over this sickness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if he ever had any senses?&#8221;
said Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty,&#8221; the doctor answered as he prepared
the medicines; &#8220;but he hasn&#8217;t used
them for twenty years.&mdash;I&#8217;ll come back in
an hour and fetch Bill Benson with me. Then
I&#8217;ll stay till I can bring Caleb back to consciousness.
We shall have to get him downstairs
as soon as he can be moved; it will be
much easier to take care of him there.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The details of Caleb Kimball&#8217;s illness
would be such as fill a nurse&#8217;s bedside record
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
book. The mainspring of life had been
snapped and the machinery refused to move
for a long time. When he recovered consciousness
his solemn black eyes followed
Amanda Dalton&#8217;s movements as if fascinated,
but he spoke no word save a faltering phrase
or two at night to William Benson.</p>
<p>Meantime much had been happening below-stairs,
where Amanda Dalton reigned
supreme, with Susan Benson and Abby
Thatcher taking turns in housework or
nursing. William Benson was a painter by
trade, and Amanda&#8217;s ingenious idea was to
persuade him to paint and paper the Kimball
kitchen before Caleb was moved downstairs.</p>
<p>This struck William as a most extraordinary
and unnecessary performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Israel in Egypt!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the matter with you women? I never heard
o&#8217; such goin&#8217;s-on in my life! I might lay abed
a thousand years an&#8217; nobody&#8217;d paint my
premises. Let Caleb git his strength back
an&#8217; then use a little elbow grease on his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
house&mdash;you can&#8217;t teach an old dog new
tricks, Susan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pends on how old the dog is, an&#8217; what
kind o&#8217; tricks you want to teach him,&#8221; Susan
replied. &#8220;It&#8217;d be a queer dog that wouldn&#8217;t
take to a clean kennel, or three good
meals a day &#8217;stead o&#8217; starvation vittles.
Amanda says it may be a kind of a turnin&#8217;-point
in Caleb&#8217;s life, an&#8217; she thinks we&#8217;d
ought to encourage him a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I encouragin&#8217; him by sleepin&#8217; on
his settin&#8217;-room lounge every night an&#8217; givin&#8217;
him medicine every two hours by the alarm
clock? I&#8217;ve got my own day&#8217;s work to do;
when would I paint his kitchen, I&#8217;d like
to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought probably you&#8217;d like to do
it nights,&#8221; suggested his wife timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saul in Tarsus! Don&#8217;t that beat the
devil?&#8221; ejaculated William. &#8220;Caleb Kimball
ain&#8217;t done a good day&#8217;s work for years,
an&#8217; I&#8217;m to set up nights paintin&#8217; his kitchen!&#8221;
Nevertheless the magnificent impertinence
of the idea so paralyzed his will that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
he ended by putting on twelve single rolls
of fawn-colored paper and painting the woodwork
yellow to harmonize, working from
eight to twelve several nights and swearing
freely at his own foolishness.</p>
<p>By this time Amanda had made the
downstairs chamber all tidy and comfortable
for the patient. She had contributed a window
shade and dimity curtains; Susan a
braided rug and a chair cushion. The chamber
(the one in which Caleb&#8217;s mother had
died) opened from the kitchen and commanded
an enticing view of the fresh yellow
walls and shining cook-stove. On the day
before Caleb&#8217;s removal Amanda sat on the
foot of the bed and looked through the doorway
with silent joy, going to and fro to
move a bright tin dipper into plainer view
or retire a drying dish-cloth to greater
privacy.</p>
<p>Even Abby Thatcher was by this time a
trifle exhilarated. She did not understand
the situation very well, being of a sternly
practical nature herself, but she caught the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
enthusiasm of the two women and scrubbed
the kitchen floor faithfully every morning
in order to remove the stains of years of
neglect.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think your old hen &#8217;d be
such a fool, Miss Dalton,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but
I kind o&#8217; surmised the reason she&#8217;s been
missin&#8217;, an&#8217; I found her to-day in a corner
o&#8217; the haymow sittin&#8217; on five eggs. Now,
wouldn&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose at her age she&#8217;d know
better than to try an&#8217; raise chickens in
October?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;ll die if it should be a
cold fall, with nobody to look after &#8217;em; but
maybe I can take &#8217;em home to my shed an&#8217;
lend Mr. Kimball another hen.&#8221; (Amanda&#8217;s
tone was motherly.) &#8220;I never like to break
up a hen&#8217;s nest, somehow; it seems as if
they must have feelin&#8217;s like other folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d take her off quicker&#8217;n scat, an&#8217; keep
takin&#8217; her off, till she got some sense,&#8221; said
Abby, with the Chinese cruelty of sixteen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you let her be till Mr. Kimball gets
well enough to ask; an&#8217; I think, Abby, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
might clean up the dooryard just a little
mite this mornin&#8217;,&#8221; suggested Amanda.
&#8220;If you could straighten up the fence an&#8217;
find a couple of old hinges to hang the gate
with, it would kind o&#8217; put new heart into
Mr. Kimball when he&#8217;s sittin&#8217; up an&#8217; lookin&#8217;
out the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he put heart into hisself by
hangin&#8217; his <i>own</i> gate, before he took sick?&#8221;
grumbled Abby, reducing Amanda to momentary
silence by her pitiless logic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he, indeed?&#8221; echoed her
heart gloomily, receiving nothing in the way
of answer from her limited experience of men.</p>
<p>Caleb had spoken more frequently the
last few days. When by the combined exertions
of the Bensons and the doctor he
had been brought down into his mother&#8217;s
old room, Amanda closed the kitchen door,
thinking one experience at a time was
enough for a man in his weak and exhausted
condition. William Benson couldn&#8217;t
see any sense in this precaution, but he never
did see much sense in what women-folks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
did. He wanted to show Caleb the new paint
and paper immediately, and remark casually
that he had done all the work while he
was &#8220;night-nursin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning Amanda had seized a
good opportunity to open the door between
the two rooms, straightway retiring to the
side entry to await developments. In a few
moments she heard Caleb moving, and going
in found him half sitting up in bed, leaning
on his elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the kitchen?&#8221;
he asked feebly, staring with wide-open eyes
at the unaccustomed prospect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only fresh paint an&#8217; paper; that&#8217;s William&#8217;s
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O God, I ain&#8217;t worth it! I ain&#8217;t worth
it!&#8221; he groaned as he hid his face in the
pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been here all the time?&#8221; he
asked Amanda when she brought him his
gruel later in the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, off an&#8217; on, when I could get away
from my own work.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who found me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did. I knew by the looks somethin&#8217; was
wrong up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somethin&#8217; wrong, sure enough, an&#8217; always
was!&#8221; Amanda heard him mutter as
he turned his face to the wall.</p>
<p>The next day he opened his eyes suddenly
as she was passing through the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you make that pie William Benson
brought me last month?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What made you think I did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know; it looked, an&#8217; it
tasted like one o&#8217; yours,&#8221; he said, closing
his eyes again. &#8220;If you know a woman, you
can tell her pie, somehow!&#8221;</p>
<p>When had Caleb Kimball ever tasted any
of her cooking? A mysterious remark, but
everything he said sounded a trifle lightheaded.</p>
<p>His questions came back to her when she
was waiting for William Benson at twilight
that same day.</p>
<p>Caleb had been sleeping quietly for an
hour or more. Amanda was standing at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
stove stirring his arrowroot gruel. The
kitchen was still.</p>
<p>A smothered &#8220;<i>miaow</i>&#8221; and the scratching
of claws on wood arrested her attention,
and she went hurriedly to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tristram Dalton; what <i>are</i> you up here
for, away from your own home?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Tristram vouchsafed no explanation of
his appearance, but his demeanor spoke
louder than words to Amanda&#8217;s guilty conscience,
as he walked in.</p>
<p>&#8220;No shelter for me but the shed these
days!&#8221; he seemed to say. &#8220;Instead of well-served
meals, a cup of milk set here or there!&#8221;</p>
<p>He made the circuit of the kitchen discontentedly
and finding nothing to his taste
went into the adjoining room, and after
walking over the full length of Caleb&#8217;s
prostrate form curled himself up in a hollow
at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve neglected him!&#8221; thought Amanda;
&#8220;but his turn&#8217;ll come again soon enough,&#8221;
and she bent her eyes on the gruel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>The blue bowl sat in the pan of hot water
on the stove, and she stirred and stirred,
slowly, regularly, continuously, in order
that the arrowroot should be of a velvety
smoothness.</p>
<p>The days were drawing in, and the October
sun was setting very yellow, sending a
flood of light over her head and shoulders.
She wore her afternoon dress of alpaca, with
a worked muslin collar and cuffs and a white
apron tied round her trim waist. She was
one of your wholesome shining women and
her bright brown hair glistened like satin.</p>
<p>Caleb&#8217;s black eyes looked yearningly at
her as she stood there all unconscious, doing
one of her innumerable neighborly kindnesses
for him.</p>
<p>She made a picture of sweet, strong,
steady womanliness, although she did not
know it. Caleb knew something extraordinary
was going on inside of him, but under
what impulse he was too puzzled and inexperienced
to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amanda.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Amanda turned sharply at the sound of
his voice as she was lifting the steaming
arrowroot out of the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose cat is this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine.&mdash;Come off that bed, Tristram!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t disturb him; I like to have him
there.&mdash;Where&#8217;s Abby Thatcher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone home on an errand; she&#8217;ll
be back in fifteen minutes now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s William?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only five o&#8217;clock. He don&#8217;t come till
six. What can I get for you? Have you had
a good sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>She set the gruel on the back of the stove
and went in to his bedside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t sleep much; I just lie an&#8217; think
... Amanda, ... now, they&#8217;re all away,
... if I get over this spell, ... an&#8217; take
a year to straighten up an&#8217; get hold o&#8217; things
like other folks, ... do you think ... you&#8217;d
risk ... marryin&#8217; me?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s dead silence; then
Amanda said, turning pale: &#8220;Are you in
your right mind, Caleb Kimball?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am, but I don&#8217;t wonder at your askin&#8217;,&#8221;
said the man humbly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve kind o&#8217;
fancied you for years; but you&#8217;ve always
been way down there across the fields, out
o&#8217; reach!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too amazed to think it out,&#8221; faltered
Amanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it out, for God&#8217;s sake,
or you&#8217;ll never do it!&#8221; He caught at her
hand as if it had been a life-line&mdash;her kind,
smooth hand, the helpful hand with the
bit of white cambric bound round a finger
burned in his service.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the kitchen that put the courage
into me,&#8221; he went on feverishly. &#8220;I laid
here an&#8217; thought: &#8216;If she can make a house
look so different in a week, what could she do
with a man?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t afraid but I could,&#8221; stammered
Amanda; &#8220;if the man would help&mdash;not
hinder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just try me, Amanda. I wouldn&#8217;t need
a year&mdash;honest, I wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;I could show
you in three months!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>Caleb&#8217;s strength was waning now. His
head dropped forward and Amanda caught
it on her breast. She put one arm round
his shoulders to keep him from falling back,
while her other hand supported his head.
His cheek was wet and as she felt the tears
on her palm, mutely calling to her strength,
all the woman in her gathered itself together
and rushed to meet the man&#8217;s need.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only ... you could take me ...
now ... right off,&#8221; he faltered; &#8220;before
anything happens ... to prevent? I&#8217;d be
good to you ... till the day I die!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t afraid to risk it, Caleb,&#8221; said
Amanda. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take you now when you need
me the most. We&#8217;ll just put our two forlorn
houses together an&#8217; see if we can make &#8217;em
into a home!&#8221;</p>
<p>Caleb gave one choking sob of content
and gratitude. His hand relaxed its clasp of
Amanda&#8217;s; his head dropped and he fainted.</p>
<p>William Benson came in just then.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he cried, coming
quickly toward the bed. &#8220;Has he had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
spell? He was so much better last night I
expected to see him settin&#8217; up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come to in a minute,&#8221; said Amanda.
&#8220;Give me the palm-leaf fan. We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
be married in a day or so, an&#8217; he got kind of
excited talkin&#8217; it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moses in the bulrushes!&#8221; ejaculated
William Benson, sitting down heavily in
the nearest chair.</p>
<p>William Benson was not a sentimental
or imaginative person, and he confessed he
couldn&#8217;t make head nor tail out o&#8217; the affair;
said it was the queerest an&#8217; beatin&#8217;est weddin&#8217;
that ever took place in Bonny Eagle;
didn&#8217;t know when they fixed it up, nor how,
nor why, if you come to that. Amanda Dalton
had never had a beau, but she was the
likeliest woman in the village, spite o&#8217; that,
an&#8217; Caleb Kimball was the onlikeliest man.
Amanda was the smartest woman, an&#8217;
Caleb the laziest man. He kind o&#8217; thought
Amanda &#8217;d married Caleb so &#8217;t she could
clean house for him; but it seemed an awful
high price to pay for a job. He guessed she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
couldn&#8217;t bear to have his everlastin&#8217; whiteweed
seedin&#8217; itself into her hayfield, an&#8217; the
only way she could stop it was to marry
him an&#8217; weed it out. He thought, too, that
Caleb had kind o&#8217; got int&#8217; the habit o&#8217;
watchin&#8217; Mandy flyin&#8217; about down to her
place. There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; so fascinatin&#8217; as to
set still an&#8217; see other folks work. The critter
was so busy, an&#8217; so diff&#8217;rent from him,
mebbe it kind o&#8217; tantalized him.</p>
<p>The Widow Thatcher was convinced
that Mandy must have gone for Caleb
hammer &#8217;n&#8217; tongs when he was too weak
to hold out against her. No woman in her
sober senses would paper a man&#8217;s kitchen
for him unless she intended to get some use
out of it herself. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know what the
disciples would &#8217;a&#8217; done,&#8221; she said, &#8220;nor
the apostles, nor the saints, nor the archangels;
we only know what women-folks
would &#8217;a&#8217; done, and there ain&#8217;t one above
ground that would &#8217;a&#8217; cleaned Caleb Kimball&#8217;s
house without she expected to live
in it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Susan Benson had a vague instinct with
regard to the real facts of the case, but even
she mustered up courage to ask Amanda
once how the wonderful matter came about.</p>
<p>Amanda looked at Mrs. Benson with
some embarrassment, for she was not good
at confidences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Susan, you an&#8217; I&#8217;ve been brought up
together, gone to school together, experienced
religion an&#8217; joined the church together,
an&#8217; I stood up with you an&#8217; William
when you was married, so &#8217;t I&#8217;d speak out
freer to you than I would to most.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Though I wouldn&#8217;t want you to repeat
anything, Susan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t likely I would, Mandy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d no sooner got Caleb into a
clean bed an&#8217; a clean room an&#8217; begun to feed
him good food than I begun to like him.
There&#8217;s things in human hearts that I ain&#8217;t
wise enough to explain, Susan, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to try. Caleb Kimball seemed to me
like a man that was drownin&#8217;, all because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t anybody near to put a hand
under his chin an&#8217; keep his head out o&#8217; water.
I didn&#8217;t suspicion he&#8217;d let me do it! I thought
he&#8217;d just lie there an&#8217; drown, but it didn&#8217;t
turn out that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it does kind o&#8217; seem as if you&#8217;d
gone through the woods o&#8217; life to pick up a
crooked stick at last,&#8221; sighed Susan; &#8220;though
I will say, now I&#8217;ve been under Caleb Kimball&#8217;s
roof, he&#8217;s an awful sight nicer man
close to than he is fur off. So, take it all in
all, life an&#8217; men-folks bein&#8217; so uncertain, an&#8217;
old age a-creepin&#8217; on first thing you know,
perhaps it&#8217;s for the best; an&#8217; I do hope you&#8217;ll
make out to be happy, Mandy.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a quiver of real feeling in Susan
Benson&#8217;s voice, though she made no
movement to touch her friend&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be happy!&#8221; said Amanda
cheerfully. &#8220;I always did like plenty to do,
an&#8217; now I&#8217;ve got it for the rest o&#8217; my
life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only hope you can stan&#8217; his ways,
Amandy,&#8221; and Susan&#8217;s voice was still doubtful.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
&#8220;That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m afraid of; that you&#8217;re
so diff&#8217;rent you can&#8217;t never stan&#8217; his ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t have so many ways when
we&#8217;ve been married a spell,&#8221; said Amanda.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>HULDAH THE PROPHETESS</h2>
</div>

<div class='ce'>
<p>&#8220;And they went unto Huldah the</p>
<p>Prophetess and communed with her&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Huldah Rumford leaned from her bedroom
window as she finished plaiting her
hair.</p>
<p>The crowing of the white Brahma rooster
had interrupted her toilet and she craned
her neck impatiently until she discovered
that he had come from the hen-yard in
the rear and established himself on the
doorsteps, from which dominating position
he was announcing his message.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means company coming, and I
hope it&#8217;s true,&#8221; she said to herself, as she
looked absent-mindedly in the old-fashioned
looking glass, with its picture of Washington
crossing the Delaware.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were evidently wandering,
for she took her petticoat from a hook in the
closet and pulling it over her head found,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
when she searched for the buttons in the
waistband, that she had it on wrong-side
out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; she exclaimed, giving
the unoffending garment an angry twitch,
&#8220;but it does seem as if I was possessed!
I can&#8217;t keep my mind on my clothes long
enough to get them on straight! I turned my
petticoat yesterday, in spite of knowing it
brings bad luck, but to-day I just won&#8217;t take
the chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pink calico morning dress went
on without adventure. Then she carefully
emptied the water from the wash-bowl into
the jar, wiped it neatly and hung the towel
to dry; straightened the photograph of her
deceased father in its black-walnut frame;
shook the feather bed and tightened a sagging
cord under the cornhusk mattress; took
the candlestick from the light-stand by her
bedside and tripped down the attic stairs
two at a time.</p>
<p>Huldah was seventeen, which is a good
thing; she was bewitchingly pretty, which is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
a better thing; and she was in love, which is
probably the best thing of all, making due
allowance, of course, for the occasions in
which it is the worst possible thing that can
happen to anybody.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rumford was in the kitchen frying
doughnuts for breakfast. She was a comfortable
figure as she stood over the brimming
&#8220;spider&#8221; with her three-pronged fork
poised in the air. She turned the yellow
rings in the hissing fat until they were nut-brown,
then dropped them for a moment
into a bowl of powdered sugar, from which
they issued the most delicious conspirators
against the human stomach that can be
found in the catalogue of New England
cookery.</p>
<p>The table was neatly laid near the screen
door that opened from the kitchen into the
apple-orchard. A pan of buttermilk biscuits
was sitting on the back of the stove, and
half a custard pie, left from the previous
night&#8217;s supper, held the position of honor in
front of Mrs. Rumford&#8217;s seat. If the pie had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
been cereal, the doughnuts omelette, and the
saleratus biscuits leavened bread, the plot
and the course of this tale might have been
different; but that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear the Brahma rooster crowing
on the doorstep, mother?&#8221; asked Huldah.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I ain&#8217;t surprised, for I can&#8217;t seem
to keep my dish-cloth in my hand this morning;
if I&#8217;ve dropped it once I&#8217;ve dropped it a
dozen times: there&#8217;s company coming, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That rooster was crowin&#8217; on the fence
last time I seen him, and he&#8217;s up there ag&#8217;in
now,&#8221; said little Jimmy Rumford, with the
most offensive skepticism.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if he is?&#8221; asked his sister sharply.
&#8220;That means fair weather, and don&#8217;t interfere
with the sign of company coming; it
makes it all the more certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet he ain&#8217;t crowin&#8217; about Pitt Packard,&#8221;
retorted Jimmy, with a large joy
illuminating his sunburnt face. &#8220;Pitt ain&#8217;t
comin&#8217; home from Moderation this week;
he&#8217;s gone to work on the covered bridge up
there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>Huldah&#8217;s face fell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d ought to have known better than to
turn my white skirt yesterday,&#8221; she sighed.
&#8220;I never knew it to fail bringing bad luck. I
vow I&#8217;ll never do it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one o&#8217; the signs I haven&#8217;t got so
much confidence in,&#8221; said Mrs. Rumford,
skimming the cream from a pan of milk into
the churn and putting the skimmed milk
on the table. &#8220;It don&#8217;t come true with me
more &#8217;n three times out o&#8217; five, but there&#8217;s
others that never fails. You jest hold on,
Huldy; the dish-cloth and the rooster knows
as much &#8217;bout what&#8217;s goin&#8217; to happen as
your white petticoat does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest about as much,&#8221; interpolated Jimmy,
with his utterance somewhat choked by
hot doughnut.</p>
<p>Huldah sat down at the table and made
a pretense of eating something, but her
heart was heavy within her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you churning for on Friday,
mother?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I told you I am looking for strangers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
It ain&#8217;t Pitt Packard only that I expect.
Yesterday mornin&#8217; I swept a black mark on
the floor; in the afternoon I found two o&#8217; the
settin&#8217;-room chairs standin&#8217; back to back,
and my right hand kep&#8217; itchin&#8217; all day, so&#8217;t
I knew I was goin&#8217; to shake hands with somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me &#8217;t was the left hand,&#8221; said
Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never told you no such thing, Jimmy
Rumford. Eat your breakfast, and don&#8217;t
contradict your mother, or I&#8217;ll send you to
bed quick &#8217;s you finish eatin&#8217;. Don&#8217;t you tell
me what I said nor what I didn&#8217;t say, for I
won&#8217;t have it. Do you hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did!&#8221; responded Jimmy obstinately,
preparing to dodge under the table in case
of sudden necessity. &#8220;You said your left
hand itched, and it meant money comin&#8217;,
and you hoped Rube Hobson was goin&#8217; to
pay you for the turkey he bought a year ago
last Thanksgivin&#8217;-time, so there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I did,&#8221; said the widow reflectively.
&#8220;Come to think of it, so I did; it must &#8217;a&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
been a Wednesday my right hand kep&#8217;
itchin&#8217; so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And comp&#8217;ny didn&#8217;t come a Wednesday
neither,&#8221; persevered Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy Rumford, if you don&#8217;t behave
yourself and speak when you&#8217;re spoken to,
and not before, you&#8217;ll git a trouncin&#8217; that
you&#8217;ll remember consid&#8217;able of a spell
afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready for it!&#8221; replied the youngster,
darting into the shed and peeping back
into the kitchen with a malignant smile. &#8220;I
dreamt o&#8217; Baldwin apples last night.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8216;Dream fruit out o&#8217; season,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>That&#8217;s anger without reason.&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I knew when I got up you&#8217;d get mad with
me the first thing this morning, and I&#8217;m all
prepared&mdash;when you ketch me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Both women gave a sigh of relief when the
boy&#8217;s flying figure disappeared around the
corner of the barn. He was morally certain
to be in mischief wherever he was, but if
he was out of sight there was one point
gained at least.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you care so dreadfully whether
Pitt comes or not?&#8221; asked Mrs. Rumford,
now that quiet was restored, &#8220;If he don&#8217;t
come to-day, then he&#8217;ll come a Sunday; and
if he don&#8217;t come this Sunday, then he&#8217;ll
come the next one, so what&#8217;s the odds? You
and him didn&#8217;t have a fallin&#8217; out last time
he was home, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you must know it, we did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got any common sense,
Huldy? Sakes alive! I thought when I married
Daniel Rumford, if I could stand his
temper it was nobody&#8217;s business but my
own. I didn&#8217;t foresee that he had so much
he could keep plenty for his own use, and
then have a lot left to hand down to his
children, so &#8217;t I should have to live in the
house with it to the day of my death! Seems
to me if I was a girl and lived in a village
where men-folks is as scarce as they be here,
I&#8217;d be turrible careful to keep holt of a beau
after I&#8217;d got him. What in the name o&#8217;
goodness did you quarrel about?&#8221;</p>
<p>Huldah got up from the table and carried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
her plate and cup to the sink. She looked
out of the window to conceal her embarrassment,
and busied herself with preparations
for the dish-washing, so that she
could talk with greater freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had words before this, plenty
of times, but they didn&#8217;t amount to anything.
Pitt&#8217;s good, and he&#8217;s handsome, and
he&#8217;s smart; but he&#8217;s awful dictatorial and
fault-finding, and I just ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to eat
too much humble-pie before I&#8217;m married,
for fear I won&#8217;t have anything else to eat
afterwards, and it ain&#8217;t very fattening for
a steady diet. And if there ever was a hateful
old woman in the world it&#8217;s his stepmother.
I&#8217;ve heard of her saying mean
things about our family every once in a
while, but I wouldn&#8217;t tell you for fear you&#8217;d
flare up and say Pitt couldn&#8217;t come to see
me. She&#8217;s tried to set him against me ever
since we began to keep company together.
She&#8217;s never quite managed to do it, but
she&#8217;s succeeded well enough to keep me in
continual trouble.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s she got to say?&#8221; inquired Mrs.
Rumford hotly. &#8220;She never had a silk dress
in the world, till Eben Packard married
her, and everybody knows her father was a
horse-doctor and mine was a reg&#8217;lar one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t say anything about fathers,
but she did tell Almira Berry that no member
of the church in good standing could
believe in signs as you did and have hope
of salvation. She said I was a chip off the
old block, and had been raised like a heathen.
It seems when I was over there on Sunday
I refused to stand up and have my height
measured against the wall, and I told &#8217;em
if you measured heights on Sunday you&#8217;d
like as not die before the year was out. I
didn&#8217;t know then she had such a prejudice
against signs, but since that time I&#8217;ve
dragged &#8217;em in every chance I got, just to
spite her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More fool you!&#8221; said her mother, beginning
to move the dasher of the churn
up and down with a steady motion. &#8220;You
might have waited until she was your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
mother-in-law before you began to spite her.
The first thing you know you won&#8217;t get any
mother-in-law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only thing that would console
me for losing Pitt!&#8221; exclaimed Huldah.
&#8220;If I can&#8217;t marry him I don&#8217;t have to live
with her, that&#8217;s one comfort! The last thing
she did was to tell Aunt Hitty Tarbox she&#8217;d
as lief have Pitt bring one of the original
Salem witches into the house as one of the
Daniel Rumford tribe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The land sakes!&#8221; ejaculated the widow,
giving a desperate and impassioned plunge
to the churn-dasher. &#8220;Now I know why I
dreamt of snakes and muddy water the
night before she come here to the Ladies&#8217;
Aid Club. Well, she&#8217;s seventy, and she
can&#8217;t live forever; she can&#8217;t take Eben
Packard&#8217;s money into the next world with
her, either, and I guess if she could &#8217;t would
melt as soon as it got there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huldah persevered with her confession,
dropping an occasional tear in the dishwater.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Last time Pitt came here he said he
should have three or four days&#8217; vacation
the 12th of August, and he thought we&#8217;d
better get married then, if &#8217;t was agreeable
to me. I was kind of shy, and the almanac
was hanging alongside of the table, so I took
it up and looked to see what day of the week
the 12th fell on. &#8216;Oh, Pitt,&#8217; I said, &#8216;we can&#8217;t
be married on Friday; it&#8217;s dreadful unlucky.&#8217;
He began to scold then, and said I didn&#8217;t
care anything about him if I wouldn&#8217;t
marry him when it was most convenient;
and I said I would if &#8217;t was any day but
Friday; and he said that was all moonshine,
and nobody but foolish old women believed
in such nonsense; and I said there wasn&#8217;t a
girl in town that would marry him on a Friday;
and he said there was; and I asked him
to come right out and tell who he meant;
and he said he didn&#8217;t mean anybody in
particular; and I said he did; and he said,
well, Jennie Perkins would, on Friday or
Sunday or wash-day or any other day; and I
said if I was a man I vow I wouldn&#8217;t take a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
girl that was so anxious as all that; and he
said he&#8217;d rather take one that was a little
too anxious than one that wasn&#8217;t anxious
enough; and so we had it, back and forth,
till I got so mad I couldn&#8217;t see the almanac.
Then, just to show him I had more good
reasons than one, I said, &#8216;Besides, if we
should be married on a Friday we&#8217;d have to
go away on a Saturday, and ten to one
&#8217;t would rain on our wedding-trip.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why would it rain Saturday more than
any other day?&#8217; said he; and then I mistrusted
I was getting into fresh trouble, but
I was too mad to back out, and said I,
&#8216;They say it rains more Saturdays in the
year than any other day&#8217;; and he got red
in the face and said, &#8216;Where&#8217;d you get
that silly notion?&#8217; Then I said it wasn&#8217;t
any silly notion, it was Gospel truth, and
anybody that took notice of anything knew
it was so; and he said he never heard of it
in his life; and I said there was considerable
many things that he&#8217;d never heard of that
he&#8217;d be all the better for knowing; and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
said he was like Josh Billings, he&#8217;d rather
know a few things well than know so many
things that wa&#8217;n&#8217;t so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have told him how we compared
notes about rainy days at the Aid
Club,&#8221; said her mother. &#8220;You remember
Hannah Sophia Palmer hadn&#8217;t noticed it,
but the minute you mentioned it she remembered
how, when she was a child, she
was always worryin&#8217; for fear she couldn&#8217;t
wear her new hat a Sunday, and it must have
been because it was threatening weather a
Saturday, and she was afraid it would keep
up for Sunday. And the widow Buzzell said
she always picked up her apples for pie-baking
on Friday, it was so apt to be dull
or wet on a Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him all of that,&#8221; continued Huldah,
&#8220;and how old Mrs. Bascom said they
had a literary society over to Edgewood that
used to meet twice a month on Saturday
afternoons, and it rained or snowed so often
they had to change their meetings to a
Wednesday.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then the first thing I knew Pitt stood
up so straight he looked more than ten
feet tall, and says he, &#8216;If you don&#8217;t marry
me a Friday, Huldah Rumford, you don&#8217;t
marry me at all. You&#8217;re nothing but a mass
of superstition, and if you&#8217;re so scared for
fear it will rain on your wedding-bonnet a
Saturday, you can stay home under cover the
rest of your life, for all I care. I&#8217;ll wash the
top buggy, put the umbrella under the seat,
and take Jennie Perkins; she won&#8217;t be
afraid of a wetting so long as she gets it in
good company.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re right,&#8217; I said, &#8216;she won&#8217;t, especially
if the company&#8217;s a man, for she&#8217;ll
be so dumfounded at getting one of &#8217;em to
sit beside her she won&#8217;t notice if it rains
pitchforks, and so far as I&#8217;m concerned she&#8217;s
welcome to my leavings.&#8217; Then he went out
and slammed the kitchen door after him,
but not so quick that I didn&#8217;t get a good
slam on the sitting-room door first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come back,&#8221; churned Mrs. Rumford
philosophically. &#8220;Jennie Perkins has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
got a pug nose, and a good-sized mole on
one side of it. A mole on the nose is a sure
sign of bad luck in love-affairs, particularly
if it&#8217;s well to one side. He&#8217;ll come back.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>But, as a matter of fact, the days went by,
the maple-trees turned red, and Pitt Packard
did not come back to the Rumford farm.
His comings and his goings were all known
to Huldah. She knew that he took Jennie
Perkins to the Sunday-School picnic, and
escorted her home from evening meetings.
She knew that old Mrs. Packard had given
her a garnet pin, a glass handkerchief-box,
and a wreath of hair flowers made from the
intertwined tresses of the Packards and the
Doolittles. If these symptoms could by any
possibility be misinterpreted, there were various
other details of an alarmingly corroborative
character, culminating in the marriage
of Pitt to Jennie on a certain Friday
evening at eight o&#8217;clock. He not only married
her on a Friday, but he drove her to Portland
on a Saturday morning; and the Fates, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
are never above taking a little extra trouble
when they are dealing out misery, decreed
that it should be one of the freshest, brightest,
most golden mornings of the early autumn.</p>
<p>Pitt thought Portland preferable to Biddeford
or Saco as a place to pass the brief
honeymoon, if for no other reason than because
the road thither lay past the Rumford
house. But the Rumfords&#8217; blinds were
tightly closed on the eventful Saturday, and
an unnecessarily large placard hung ostentatiously
on the front gate, announcing to
passers-by that the family had gone to Old
Orchard Beach, and would be home at sundown.
This was a bitter blow to the bridegroom,
for he had put down the back of the
buggy with the intention of kissing the bride
within full view of the Rumford windows.
When he found it was of no use, he abandoned
the idea, as the operation never afforded
him any especial pleasure. He asked
Mrs. Pitt if she preferred to go to the beach
for her trip, but she decidedly favored the
gayeties of a metropolis.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>The excitement of passing the Rumford
house having faded, Jennie&#8217;s nose became
so oppressive to Pitt that he finally changed
places with her, explaining that he generally
drove on the left side. He was more tranquil
then, for her left profile was more pleasing,
though for the life of him he could not help
remembering Huldah&#8217;s sweet outlines, the
dimple in her chin, her kissable mouth, her
delicate ear. Why, oh, why, had she inherited
her father&#8217;s temper and her mother&#8217;s
gift of prophecy, to say nothing of her grandfather&#8217;s
obstinacy and her grandmother&#8217;s
nimble tongue! All at once it dawned upon
him that he might have jilted Huldah without
marrying Jennie. It would, it is true,
have been only a half revenge; but his appetite
for revenge was so dulled by satisfaction
he thought he could have been perfectly
comfortable with half the quantity,
even if Huldah were not quite so uncomfortable
as he wished her to be. He dismissed
these base and disloyal sentiments,
however, as bravely as he could, and kissed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
Jennie twice, in a little stretch of wood road
that fell in opportunely with his mood of
silent penitence.</p>
<p>About two o&#8217;clock clouds began to gather
in the sky, and there was a muttering of
thunder. Pitt endured all the signs of a
shower with such fortitude as he could
command, and did not put up the buggy-top
or unstrap the boot until the rain came down
in good earnest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;d have suspicioned this kind of
weather?&#8221; he growled as he got the last
strap into place and shook the water from
his new straw hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid of it, but I didn&#8217;t like to
speak out,&#8221; said Jennie primly; &#8220;they say
it gen&#8217;ally does rain Saturdays.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Meanwhile Huldah lay in the spare room
at the back of the house and sobbed quietly.
Mrs. Rumford and the skeptical Jimmy
had gone to Old Orchard, and Huldah had
slipped out of the front door, tacked the obtrusive
placard on the gate-post, and closed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
all the blinds in honor of the buried hopes
that lay like a dead weight at the bottom of
her heart.</p>
<p>She was a silly little thing, a vain little
thing, and a spitfire to boot, but that did
not prevent her suffering an appreciable
amount, all that her nature would allow;
and if it was not as much as a larger nature
would have suffered, neither had she much
philosophy or strength to bear it. The burden
is fitted to the back as often as the back
to the burden.</p>
<p>She frequently declared to herself afterwards
that she should have had &#8220;a fit of
sickness&#8221; if it had not been for the thunderstorm
that came up on that never-to-be-forgotten
Saturday afternoon. She had
waked that morning with a dull pain in her
heart&mdash;a dull pain that had grown keener
when she looked from her attic window and
saw the sun shining clear in the sky. Not a
cloud sullied the surface of that fair blue
canopy on this day of the faithless Pitt&#8217;s
wedding-journey. A sweet wind blew the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
tail feathers of the golden cock on the
squire&#8217;s barn till he stared the west directly
in the eye. What a day to drive to Portland!
She would have worn tan-colored low shoes
and brown openwork stockings (what ugly
feet Jennie Perkins had!), a buff challie
dress with little brown autumn leaves on it,
a belt and sash of brown watered ribbon
(Jennie had a waist like a flour-barrel!),
and a sailor hat with a bunch of yellow roses
on one side&mdash;or would two brown quills,
standing up coquettishly, have been more
attractive? Then she would have taken a
brown cloth shoulder-cape, trimmed with
rows upon rows of cream-colored lace, and a
brown parasol with an acorn of polished wood
on the handle. Oh, what was the use of living
when she could wear none of this bridal
apparel, but must put on her old pink
calico and go down to meet Jimmy&#8217;s brotherly
sneers? Was there ever such a cruelly
sunshiny morning? A spot of flickering light
danced and quivered on her blue wallpaper
until she could bear it no longer, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
pinned a towel over it. She sat down by the
open window and leaned dejectedly on the
sill, the prettiest picture of spiteful, unnecessary
misery that the eye of mortal man
ever rested upon, with her bright hair
tumbling over her unbleached nightgown,
and her little bare feet curled about the
chair-rounds like those of a disconsolate
child. Nobody could have approved of, or
even sympathized with, so trivial a creature,
but plenty of people would have been
so sorry for her that they would have taken
sensible, conscientious, unattractive Jennie
Perkins out of Pitt Packard&#8217;s buggy and
substituted the heedless little Huldah, just
for the pleasure of seeing her smile and
blush. There was, however, no guardian
imp to look after her ruined fortunes, and
she went downstairs as usual to help about
the breakfast, wondering to herself if there
were any tragedies in life too terrible to be
coexistent with three meals a day and the
dishes washed after each one of them.</p>
<p>An infant hope stirred in her heart when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
she saw a red sparkle here and there on the
sooty bottom of the tea-kettle, and it grew
a little when her mother remarked that the
dishwater boiled away so fast and the cows
lay down so much that she believed it would
rain the next day. When, that same afternoon,
the welcome shower came with scarce
ten minutes&#8217; warning, Huldah could hardly
believe her eyes and ears. She jumped from
her couch of anguish and remorse like an excited
kitten, darted out of the house unmindful
of the lightning, drove the Jersey calf
under cover, chased the chickens into the
coop, bolstered up the tomatoes so that the
wind and rain would not blow the fruit from
the heavily laden plants, opened the blinds
and closed the windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;It comes from the east,&#8221; she cried, dancing
up and down in a glow of childish glee&mdash;&#8220;it
comes from the east, and it&#8217;s blowing in
on Jennie&#8217;s side of the buggy!&#8221; She did not
know that Pitt had changed places with his
bride, and that his broad shoulder was shielding
her from the &#8220;angry airt.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>Then she flew into the kitchen and pinned
up her blown hair in front of the cracked
looking-glass, thinking with sympathetic
tenderness how pretty she looked, with her
crown of chestnut tendrils tightened by the
dampness, her round young cheeks crimsoned
by the wind, and her still tearful eyes
brightened by unchristian joy. She remembered
with naughty satisfaction how rain
invariably straightened Jennie Perkins&#8217;s
frizzes, and was glad, <i>glad</i> that it did. Her
angry passions were so beautifying that the
radiant vision in the glass almost dazzled
her. It made her very sorry for Pitt too. She
hated to think that his ill-temper and stubborn
pride and obstinacy had lost him such
a lovely creature as herself, and had forced
him to waste his charms on so unappreciative
and plain a person as Jennie Perkins.
She remembered that Pitt had asked her to
marry him coming home from the fair in a
rainstorm. If he meant anything he said on
that occasion, he must be suffering pangs of
regret to-day. Oh, how good, how sweet, how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
kind of it to rain and support her in what
she had prophesied of Saturday weather!</p>
<p>All at once a healing thought popped into
her head. &#8220;I shall not live many years,&#8221; she
reflected&mdash;&#8220;not after losing Pitt, and having
his mother crow over me, and that hateful
Jennie Perkins, having the family hair wreath
hanging over her sofa, and my wedding ring
on her hand; but so long as I live I will keep
account of rainy Saturdays, and find a way
to send the record to Pitt every New Year&#8217;s
Day just to prove that I was right. Then I
shall die young, and perhaps he will plant
something on my grave, and water it with
his tears; and perhaps he will put up a marble
gravestone over me, unbeknownst to
Jennie, and have an appropriate verse of
Scripture carved on it, something like:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' font-variant:small-caps;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>she openeth her mouth with wisdom;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>and in her tongue is the law of kindness</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I can see it as plain as if it was written. I hope
they will make it come out even on the edges,
and that he will think to have a white marble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
dove perched on the top, unless it costs too
much.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The years went on. Huldah surprised
everybody by going away from home to get
an education. She would have preferred marriage
at that stage of her development, but
to her mind there was no one worth marrying
in Pleasant River save Pitt Packard, and,
failing him, study would fill up the time as
well as anything else.</p>
<p>The education forced a good many helpful
ideas into pretty Huldah&#8217;s somewhat
empty pate, though it by no means cured
her of all her superstitions. She continued
to keep a record of Saturday weather, and
it proved as interesting and harmless a
hobby as the collecting of china or postage-stamps.</p>
<p>In course of time Pitt Packard moved to
Goshen, Indiana, where he made a comfortable
fortune by the invention of an estimable
pump, after which he was known by his full
name of W. Pitt Fessenden Packard. In course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
of time the impish and incredulous Jimmy
Rumford became James, and espoused the
daughter of a wealthy Boston merchant. His
social advancement was no surprise to Huldah
and her mother, for, from the moment
he had left home, they had never dreamed of
him save in conjunction with horned cattle,
which is well known to signify unexampled
prosperity.</p>
<p>In course of time, too, old Mrs. Rumford
was gathered to her fathers after a long illness,
in which Huldah nursed her dutifully
and well. Her death was not entirely unexpected,
for Hannah Sophia Palmer observed
spots like iron rust on her fingers, a dog
howled every night under Almira Berry&#8217;s
window, and Huldah broke the kitchen
looking-glass. No invalid could hope for recovery
under these sinister circumstances,
and Mrs. Rumford would have been the
last woman in the world to fly in the face of
such unmistakable signs of death. It is even
rumored that when she heard the crash of
glass in the kitchen she murmured piously,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
&#8220;Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in
peace,&#8221; and expired within the hour.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Nineteen summers and winters had passed
since Pitt Packard drove &#8220;her that was Jennie
Perkins&#8221; to Portland on her wedding-trip.
He had been a good and loyal husband;
she had been a good and faithful wife; and
never once in the nineteen years had they
so much as touched the hem of the garment
of happiness.</p>
<p>Huldah the Prophetess lived on in the old
house alone. Time would have gone slowly
and drearily enough had it not been for her
ruling passion. If the first part of the week
were fair, she was hopeful that there was
greater chance of rain or snow by Saturday;
if it were rainy, she hoped there would be a
long storm. She kept an elaborate table showing
the weather on every day of the year.
Fair Saturdays were printed in red ink, foul
Saturdays in jet-black. The last days of December
were generally spent in preparing a
succinct statement from these daily entries.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
Then in the month of January a neat document,
presenting facts and figures, but no
word of personal comment or communication,
was addressed at first to Mr. W. P.
Packard, and of late years to W. Pitt Fessenden
Packard, and sent to Goshen, Indiana.</p>
<p>Mr. Packard was a good and loyal husband,
as I have said, but there was certainly
no disloyalty in the annual perusal of statistical
weather tables. That these tables,
though made out by one of the weaker sex,
were accurate and authentic, he had reason
to believe, because he kept a rigid account
of the weather himself, and compared
Huldah&#8217;s yearly record with his own. The
weather in Pleasant River did not, it is true,
agree absolutely with the weather in Goshen,
but the similarity between Maine and Indiana
Saturdays was remarkable. The first five
years of Pitt&#8217;s married life Huldah had the
advantage, and the perusal of her tables afforded
Pitt little satisfaction, since it proved
that her superstitions had some apparent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
basis of reason. The next five years his turn
came, and the fair Saturdays predominated.
He was not any happier, however, on the
whole, because, although he had the pleasure
of being right himself, he lost the pleasure
of believing Huldah right. So time went
on until Mrs. Pitt died, and was buried under
the handsomest granite monument that
could be purchased by the sale of pumps.
Not only were the funeral arrangements
carried out with the liveliest consideration
for the departed, but Mr. Packard abstained
from all gay society and conducted himself
with the greatest propriety. Nevertheless,
when his partner and only confidential
friend extolled Jennie&#8217;s virtues as wife,
housekeeper, companion, and church member,
he remarked absently: &#8220;She was all
that, Jim, but somehow I never liked
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>For two years after his bereavement Huldah
omitted sending her weather statistics
to Mr. Packard, thinking, with some truth,
that it might seem too marked an attention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
from an attractive Maine spinster to a
&#8220;likely&#8221; Indiana widower.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Matters were in this state when Mr. Packard
alighted at the Edgewood station one
bright day in August. He declined the offer
of a drive, and soon found himself on the
well-remembered road to Pleasant River.
He had not trodden that dusty thoroughfare
for many a year, and every tree and shrub
and rock had a message for him, though he
was a plain, matter-of-fact maker of pumps.
There was no old home to revisit, for his
stepmother had died long ago, and Jennie
had conscientiously removed the family
wreath from the glass case and woven some
of the departed lady&#8217;s hair into the funereal
garland. He walked with the brisk step of a
man who knew what he wanted, but there
was a kind of breathless suspense in his manner
which showed that he was uncertain of
getting it. He passed the Whippoorwill Mill,
the bubbling spring, the old moss-covered
watering-trough, and then cut across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
widow Buzzell&#8217;s field straight to the Rumford
farm. He kept rehearsing the subject-matter
of a certain speech he intended to
make. He knew it by heart, having repeated
it once a day for several months, but nobody
realized better than he that he would
forget every word of it the moment he saw
Huldah&mdash;at least, if the Huldah of to-day
were anything like the Huldah of the olden
time.</p>
<p>The house came in sight. It used to be
painted white; it was drab now, and there
was a bay-window in the sitting-room. There
was a new pump in the old place, and, happy
omen, he discovered it was one of his own
manufacture. He made his way by sheer
force of habit past the kitchen windows to
the side door. That was where they had quarreled
mostly. He had a kind of sentiment
about that side door. He paused a moment
to hide his traveling-bag under the grapevine
that shaded the porch, and as he raised
his hand to grasp the knocker the blood
rushed to his face and his heart leaped into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
his throat. Huldah stood near the window
winding the old clock. In her right hand was
a &#8220;Farmer&#8217;s Almanac.&#8221; How well he knew
the yellow cover! and how like to the Huldah
of seventeen was the Huldah of thirty-six!
It was incredible that the pangs of disappointed
love could make so little inroad on
a woman&#8217;s charms. Rosy cheeks, plump figure,
clear eyes, with a little more snap in
them than was necessary for connubial comfort,
but not a whit too much for beauty;
brown hair curling round her ears and temples&mdash;what
an ornament to a certain house
he knew in Goshen, Indiana!</p>
<p>She closed the wooden door of the clock,
and, turning, took a generous bite from the
side of a mellow August sweeting that lay
on the table. At this rather inauspicious moment
her eye caught Pitt&#8217;s. The sight of her
old lover drove all prudence and reserve from
her mind, and she came to the door with
such an intoxicating smile and such welcoming
hands that he would have kissed her
then and there, even if he had not come to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Pleasant River for that especial purpose. Of
course he forgot the speech, but his gestures
were convincing, and he mumbled a sufficient
number of extracts from it to convince
Huldah that he was in a proper frame of
mind&mdash;this phrase meaning to a woman
the one in which she can do anything she
likes with a man.</p>
<p>They were too old, doubtless, to cry and
laugh in each other&#8217;s arms, and ask forgiveness
for past follies, and regret the wasted
years, and be thankful for present hope and
life and love; but that is what they did, old
as they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have any business to ask you
to marry such a dictatorial fool as I used to
be, Huldah,&#8221; said Pitt; &#8220;but I&#8217;ve got over
considerable of my foolishness, and do say
you will. Say, too, you won&#8217;t make me wait
any longer, but marry me Sunday or Monday.
This is Thursday, and I must be back
in Goshen next week at this time. Will you,
Huldah?&#8221;</p>
<p>Huldah blushed, but shook her head. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
looked lovely when she blushed, and she
hadn&#8217;t lost the trick of it even at thirty-six.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s soon; but never mind getting
ready. If you won&#8217;t say Monday, make it
Tuesday&mdash;do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wednesday, then. <i>Do</i> say Wednesday,
Huldy dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same smile of gentle negation.</p>
<p>He dropped her hand disconsolately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have to come back at Christmas-time,
I s&#8217;pose. It&#8217;s just my busy season
now, or I would stay right here on this doorstep
till you was ready, for it seems to me
as if I&#8217;d been waiting for you ever since I
was born, and couldn&#8217;t get you too soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really want me to marry you so
much, Pitt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never wanted anything so bad in my
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you wonder I wasn&#8217;t more surprised
to see you to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing surprises me in women-folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was because I&#8217;ve dreamed of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
funeral three nights running. Do you know
what that&#8217;s a sign of?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pitt never winked an eyelash; he had
learned his lesson. With a sigh of relief that
his respected stepmother was out of hearing,
he responded easily, &#8220;I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s a sign
somebody&#8217;s dead or going to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t: dreams go by contraries.
It&#8217;s a sign there&#8217;s going to be a wedding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to know that much, but I wish
while you was about it you&#8217;d have dreamt
a little more, and found out when the wedding
was going to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did; and if you weren&#8217;t the stupidest
man alive you could guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m slow-witted,&#8221; said Pitt meekly,
for he was in a mood to endure anything,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ve asked you to have me on every
day there is except the one I&#8217;m afraid to
name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I&#8217;ve had plenty of offers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless all the men-folks are blind, you
must have had a thousand, Huldah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huldah was distinctly pleased. As a matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
of fact she had had only five; but five
offers in the State of Maine implies a superhuman
power of attraction not to be measured
by the casual reader.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sorry you called me a mass of
superstition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d been horsewhipped where I
stood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then. The first time you
wouldn&#8217;t marry me at all unless you could
have me Friday, and of course I wouldn&#8217;t
take you Friday under those circumstances.
Now you say you&#8217;re glad and willing to
marry me any day in the week, and so I&#8217;ll
choose Friday of my own accord. I&#8217;ll marry
you to-morrow, Pitt: and&#8221;&mdash;here she
darted a roguishly sibylline glance at the
clouds&mdash;&#8220;I have a water-proof; have you
an umbrella for Saturday?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pitt took her at her word, you may be
sure, and married her the next day, but I
wish you could have seen it rain on Saturday!
There never was such a storm in Pleasant
River. The road to the Edgewood station
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
was a raging flood; but though the bride
and groom were drenched to the skin they
didn&#8217;t take cold&mdash;they were too happy.
Love within is a beautiful counter-irritant.</p>
<p>Huldah didn&#8217;t mind waiting a little matter
of nineteen years, so long as her maiden flag
sank in a sea of triumph at the end; and it
is but simple justice to an erring but attractive
woman to remark that she never
said &#8220;I told you so!&#8221; to her husband.</p>

<p><i>S.S. Diana, January 21, 1918</i></p>
<p><i>On the way to the Virgin Islands</i></p>
</div>

<p>I engrossed the above heading in my journal
shortly after we left the dock in New
York, but from what has occurred in the
past few days I think my occasional entries
in the log-book are likely to be records of
Dorothea Valentine&#8217;s love-affairs as they
occur to her day by day, and as unluckily
they are poured into my ear for lack of a
better or more convenient vessel.</p>
<p>We are dear friends, Dolly and I. Her
name is Dorothea, but apparently she will
have to grow up to it, for at present everybody
calls her Dolly, Dora, Dot, or Dodo,
according to his or her sex, color, or previous
condition of servitude. Dolly is twenty and
I am thirty; indeed, her mother is only forty,
so that I am rather her contemporary than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
Dolly&#8217;s, but friendship is more a matter of
sympathy than relative age, and Mrs. Valentine
and I are by no means twin souls. As a
matter of fact, that lady would never have
noticed me, the private secretary of Clive
Winthrop, a government official in Washington,
had it not been that, through him and
his sister, I had access to a more interesting
group in society than had Mrs. Valentine, a
widow of large means but a stranger in the
Capital. Clive Winthrop is a person of distinction
and influence, and Miss Ellen Winthrop,
an old friend of my mother&#8217;s, is one
of the most charming hostesses in Washington,
while I am in reality nothing but a paid
scribe; the glad, willing, ardent, but silent
assistant of a man who is serving the Administration
with all his heart; but neither
he nor his sister will have it so considered.
I almost think that Miss Ellen Winthrop,
still vivacious and vigorous at seventy, is
ready to give up to me her place as head of
the household if I consent to say the word;
but I am not sure enough yet to say it; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
because of that uncertainty I cannot trust
myself in the daily company of the two persons
most deeply concerned in my decision.</p>
<p>A sea voyage is the best thing in the world
to blow away doubts or difficulties; it also
clears the air so that one can see one&#8217;s course,
whether it be toward the north of duty or
the south of desire.</p>
<p>My work for a long time has been to report
interviews, take stenographic records,
and write hundreds of letters for Mr. Winthrop
during the somewhat protracted discussion
that preceded the acquisition of the
Virgin Islands by the United States. It is
odd that these tasks should have fallen to
me, who added below Clive Winthrop&#8217;s signature
to many communications the typed
initials C. A. C., for I have a special interest
in these new possessions of ours, a very close
and sentimental one, since I was born on
St. Thomas, one of the Virgin Islands, and
christened Charlotte Amalia after the little
red-roofed town on the shore of the perfect
harbor. My birth in St. Thomas was entirely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
unpremeditated, and I was taken away as
soon as my mother was able to travel; nevertheless,
I have always longed during the
twelve years of my loneliness, without father
or mother, to see the place where they were
so happy in each other and so blissful in the
prospect of my appearance.</p>
<p>I, then, have a right to this particular holiday
and this opportunity to decide my future.
Miss Dorothea Valentine, on the contrary,
is a wholly unexpected, I will not say
an unwelcome, companion, although when
I wish to be thinking of my own problems
she generally desires to discuss hers, which
are trivial, though interesting and unique.</p>
<p>Everything about the girl piques interest;
her beauty, her charm, her childlike gayety
and inconsequence, which are but the upper
current of a deeper sea of sincerity and common
sense. Somebody says: &#8220;Ladies vary
in looks; they&#8217;re like military flags for a
funeral or a celebration&mdash;one day furled,
next day streaming. Men are ships; figureheads,
about the same in a storm or a calm,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
and not too handsome, thanks to the ocean.&#8221;
The last phrases are peculiarly true of Clive
Winthrop, who is sometimes called the ugliest
man in Washington, yet who commands
attention in any room that he enters because
of his fine physique, his noble head, and his
distinction of bearing and speech. Rugged
he is, &#8220;thanks to the ocean,&#8221; but he looks as
if he could swim against the strongest current.
On the other hand, it cannot be said
that Dolly Valentine varies. She is lovely at
breakfast, lovelier at luncheon, and loveliest
at dinner when the dazzling whiteness of her
neck and shoulders is revealed. Only a tolerably
generous woman would suffer herself to
be in the almost daily companionship of such
a charmer, and that I am in that dangerous
juxtaposition is her fault, not mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must take me with you on your sea
voyage, Charlotte,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I must get
away from Washington and from mother.
No, don&#8217;t raise your eye-brows and begin
to scold before you know what I mean! I
am not going to criticize my maternal parent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
but I am so under her thumb at the
moment that I am a flabby mass of indecision.
I have no more mind than a jellyfish,
yet I have to decide a matter of vital importance
within a month. How can I make
up a non-existent mind? Answer me that.
Your life is so fixed and serene and settled;
so full of absorbing work; you are so flattered
and appreciated that you are like a big ship
anchored in a safe harbor, and you can&#8217;t
think what it&#8217;s like to be a silly little yacht
bobbing about on the open sea!&#8221; (Such is
the uncomprehending viewpoint of twenty
toward thirty; the calm assumption that
ladies of that mature age can have no love-affairs
of their own to perplex them!)</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no need of your being a silly
little yacht, Dolly!&#8221; I answered. &#8220;If you
want to make a real voyage you have the
power to choose your craft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother always chooses for me,&#8221; she
said with a pout. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t gag me and
put me in irons and lead me up the gangplank
by brute force, but she dominates me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
I start out each morning like a nice, fat, pink
balloon and by evening, though I haven&#8217;t
felt any violent pin-pricks, I am nothing but
a little shrunken heap of shriveled rubber.
You know it, Charlotte! You have seen me
bouncing at breakfast and seen me flat at
dinner!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was impossible not to laugh at her.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous!&#8221; I expostulated.
&#8220;There is nothing between you and happiness
but a little cloud so diaphanous that a
breath of common sense would blow it away.
Now read your magazine and let me write
in my log-book. It is intended to be an informal
report to my chief, of the islands we
are to visit. We shall be at St. Thomas to-morrow
morning and in the four days we
have been journeying from New York the
only topic of conversation in which you
have shown the slightest enthusiasm is
whether you should or should not marry
Marmaduke Hogg!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call him all of it, Charlotte,&#8221; and
she shuddered. &#8220;Mother is always doing it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
and I can&#8217;t bear it!&#8221; whereupon she flounced
about on her deck-chair and hid her face in
her steamer-rug.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was a foolish little love-story, that of
Dorothea Valentine. Her mother was a mass
of polite and unnecessary conventions; a
pretty sort of person with a clear profile like
that of a cold, old little bird. Her small, sharp
nose resembled a beak; her eyes were like
two black beads; and her conversation was
a lengthy series of twitterings. Charlotte
Clifford used to tell Miss Winthrop that if
Mrs. Valentine had been a canary, people
would have forever been putting a towel
over her cage to secure silence. She was always
idle, save for a bewildering succession
of reconstruction periods, apparently forestalling
ruins that no one else could have
prophesied. She dieted and reduced her hips;
had violet rays applied to her scalp; had
her wrinkles ironed out by some mysterious
process. If you caught her before ten in the
morning you would find her with crescent-shaped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
bits of court-plaster beside her eyes,
in front of her ears, and between her brows.
She was beautifully clothed, shod, gloved,
massaged, manicured, and marcelled. She
lived on the best sides of the streets and
at the proper hotels. She answered notes,
returned calls, and gave wedding presents
punctiliously. She never used the telephone
for invitations, nor had anything but contempt
for abbreviations, carefully writing
out Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Minneapolis,
Minnesota, when she addressed her
sisters in those cities. A mass of the most
glaring virtues was Mrs. Reginald Valentine,
impeccable and unassailable, with views on
all subjects as rigid as the laws of the Medes
and Persians. She had ordered her husband&#8217;s
life during their ten years of marriage, he
being a gentle and artistic soul, and she had
more or less directed his exercise, amusements,
diet, as well as his political and religious
opinions. She nursed him faithfully
in his last illness, but when he timidly begged
to be cremated instead of buried, she reminded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
him that it was a radical, ultra-modern
idea; that the Valentine lot and monument
were very beautiful; that there never
had been any cremations in the family connection;
and that she hoped he would not
break a long-established custom and leave
behind him a positively irreligious request.
Various stories of Mr. Valentine&#8217;s docility
had crept into circulation, and it is said that
on this occasion he turned his head meekly
to the wall and sighed: &#8220;Very well, Emma!
Do just as you think best; it&#8217;s your funeral!&#8221;</p>
<p>Just how Dorothea blossomed on this stalk
it is difficult to say. A bright-eyed, sunshiny,
willful baby, she had grown into an unaffected,
attractive, breezy young woman,
outwardly obedient, inwardly mutinous. She
was generally calm in her mother&#8217;s presence,
never criticizing her openly, and her merry
heart kept her from being really unhappy
in a relationship that many girls would have
found intolerable. Beaux she had a-plenty
and lovers not a few. As cream or honey to
flies, so was Dorothea Valentine to mankind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
in general; but she took them on gayly and
cast them off lightly, little harm being done
on either side by the brief experience.</p>
<p>Of course the suits of some of the suitors
had been hard-pressed by Mrs. Valentine.
&#8220;You will go through the woods to find a
crooked stick at last, Dorothea,&#8221; she would
say. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know a desirable <i>parti</i> when
you see one. You must have an extraordinary
opinion of your own charms to think that you
have only to pick and choose. Those charms
will fade, rather prematurely, I fear, and
when your looked-for ideal comes along it
may be that he will not regard you as flawless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect him to, mother! I only expect
him to find my own flaws interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no certainty of that, my dear,&#8221;&mdash;and
Mrs. Valentine&#8217;s tone was touched
with cynicism. &#8220;I had an intimate friend
once, Clara Wyman, a very nice girl she was,
who had been in love with my cousin Roger
Benson for years. He seemed much attached
to her and when time went by and nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
happened, I spoke to him plainly one night
and asked him if he didn&#8217;t intend to propose
to her, and if not, what were his reasons.
What do you suppose they were?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Valentine&#8217;s tone implied that a
shock was coming.</p>
<p>Dolly sat erect on her mother&#8217;s Italian
day-bed as one prepared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I have no idea&mdash;how could I
have?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger said that he didn&#8217;t like her wiping
her nose through her veil!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dolly flung herself at length on the couch
and buried her face in the cushions, her whole
body shaking convulsively with silent mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may laugh, Dorothea, but this incident,
which I have told many times, shows
how fantastic, erratic, despotic, and hypercritical
men generally are. You will come
to your senses some time and realize that
no one is likely to bear with your perversities
more patiently than Arthur Wilde or
Lee Wadsworth, who have both wasted a
winter dangling about you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>Dolly raised her head, patted her hair,
and wiped her streaming eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realize the dangerous obstacles between
me and the altar as I never did before,&#8221;&mdash;and
the girl&#8217;s voice was full of laughter.
&#8220;But I should have to lock Arthur Wilde
in the basement whenever professors came
to dinner. I couldn&#8217;t marry Arthur&#8217;s vocabulary,
mother,&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a wonderful son, and a millionaire;
he has three houses, four motors, and a steam
yacht!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, but that don&#8217;t &#8216;enthuse me,&#8217; &#8216;tremenjous&#8217;
as it sounds! (I am imitating Mr.
Wilde&#8217;s style of conversation.) And as for
Lee Wadsworth he is bow-legged!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lee&#8217;s reputation is straight at any rate,
and his income all that could be desired,&#8221;
responded Mrs. Valentine loftily. &#8220;I wish
I could convince you, Dorothea, that there
are no perfect husbands. You are looking
for the impossible! Indeed, I have always
found men singularly imperfect, even as
friends and companions, and in a more intimate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
relation they leave still more to be
desired. You dismissed Sir Thomas Scott
because he was too dictatorial, although
you knew he intended to have the family
diamonds reset for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d have had them reset in Sheffield
or Birmingham, but, anyhow, one doesn&#8217;t
marry diamonds, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One might at least make the effort, Dorothea!
I notice that most of the people who
disdain diamonds generally possess three
garnets, two amethysts, and one Mexican
opal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dolly laughed. &#8220;You know I did emulate
the celebrated Mrs. Dombey, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you made a very brief and feeble
effort to be sensible, and you might have
conquered yourself had it not been for the
sudden appearance of this young Hogg on
your horizon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not call him a young Hogg!&#8221;
cried Dolly passionately. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t fair; I
won&#8217;t endure it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that was his name,&#8221; remarked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
Mrs. Valentine, placidly shifting a wrinkle-plaster
from one place to another. &#8220;You
wouldn&#8217;t object if I had alluded to young
Benham or young Wadsworth. You show
by your very excitement how disagreeable his
name is to your ears. It isn&#8217;t a question of
argument; Marmaduke Hogg is an outrageous,
offensive name; if he had been Charles
or James it would have been more decent.
The &#8216;Marmaduke&#8217; simply calls attention to
the &#8216;Hogg.&#8217; If any one had asked to introduce
a person named Hogg to me I should
have declined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you a dozen times, mother,
that the Wilmots&#8217; house-party was at breakfast
when I arrived from the night train.
There was a perfect Babel and everybody
was calling him &#8216;Duke.&#8217; He looked like one,
and nobody said&mdash;the other. I didn&#8217;t even
hear his last name till evening, and then it
was too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Too late!&#8217; Really, Dorothea, if you
have no sense of propriety you may leave
the room!&#8221;&mdash;and Mrs. Valentine applied the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
smelling-bottle to her birdlike nose as a sign
that her nerves were racked to the limit and
she might at any moment succumb.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I know is,&#8221; continued Dorothea obstinately,
&#8220;that he was the best-looking,
the most interesting, the cleverest, the most
companionable man in the house-party, or
for that matter in the universe. You don&#8217;t
ask the last name of Orlando, or Benedick,
or Marcus Aurelius, or Albert of Belgium.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be necessary.&#8221; (Here Mrs.
Valentine was quite imperturbable.) &#8220;The
Valentines have never been required to associate
with theatrical people or foreigners. In
some ways I dislike the name of Marmaduke
as much as Hogg. It is so bombastic that it
seems somehow like an assumed name, or as
if the creature had been born on the stage.
When coupled with Hogg it loses what little
distinction it might have had by itself. One
almost wishes it had been Marmalade. Marmalade
Hogg suggests a quite nauseating
combination of food, but there is a certain
appropriateness about it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>Dorothea&#8217;s face was flaming. &#8220;You will
never allow Duke to explain himself, mother,
nor hear me through when I attempt to make
things clear to you. You never acknowledge
that you know, but you do know, that Duke&#8217;s
people were English a long way back, and
&#8216;Marmaduke&#8217; is an old family name. The
Winthrops will tell you that Duke&#8217;s father
and mother were named Forrest and that
they changed it to Hogg to pacify an old
bachelor uncle who wanted to leave Duke six
thousand dollars a year. He had no voice in
the matter; he was only twelve years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a very short-sighted business
proposition, and your Duke must have been
very young for his age,&#8221;&mdash;and Mrs. Valentine
took another deep sniff of lavender.
&#8220;Sixty thousand a year wouldn&#8217;t induce me
to be named Hogg, and I shall never consent
to have one in my family!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothea burst into tears, a most uncommon
occurrence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have dwelt so long on this purely immaterial
objection,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;that you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
have finally inoculated me with something of
your own feeling and made me miserable and
ashamed. I dare say, too, I have hurt Duke&#8217;s
pride by trying to give him a reason for your
indifferent attitude, yet never having courage
for the real, piffling explanation. I am
mortified at my despicable weakness and I
will overcome it by realizing how unworthy
I am to bear Duke&#8217;s honorable, unstained
name, even if it is Hogg. You might as well
give up, mother! If the dearest, best, most
delightful man in the world loves me, I shall
marry him, name and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not regard it as settled,&#8221; replied Mrs.
Valentine calmly. &#8220;The young man may not
think you so desirable when he learns that
my refusal to accept him as a son-in-law
means that he must take you without any income.
Your dear father must have foreseen
some such tragedy when he left all his money
in my care!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duke will take me without a penny!&#8221;
cried Dorothea hotly. &#8220;I would stake my life
on that!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be melodramatic, Dorothea. We
shall see in time. It is just possible that the
young man may not be greedy, and so belie
his name.&#8221; This was Mrs. Valentine&#8217;s last
shaft as Dorothea walked out of the room
with her chin in the air.</p>

<div class='ra'>
<p><i>S.S. Diana, January 26, 1918</i></p>
</div>

<p>St. Thomas, and Charlotte Amalia, the little
town for which I was named, looked so
lovely when we landed early this morning
that I felt a positive thrill of pride.</p>
<p>This halfway house of the sea, this gateway
of the Caribbean, as it has been picturesquely
called, seemed, as Dolly and I
climbed the hills and the stone stairways,
to materialize into a birthplace instead of a
vague dream. A year ago, with the <i>Dannebrog</i>,
the scarlet, white-crossed banner of Denmark,
floating over the red Danish fortress on the
water-front, I might have felt an alien, but
the Stars and Stripes made me feel at home
and I could only remember that my father
and mother met and loved each other in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
little Paradise, and that when I was born
there they were the two happiest people under
the sun. If they could have seen their
daughter saluting the American flag so near
the very spot in which she first saw the light,
they would have been comforted, I am sure,
instead of repining that they had both been
taken away when she most needed their love
and protection.</p>
<p>Such a view from Diana&#8217;s deck as we crept
into the wonderful harbor! A background of
towering green hills and a dazzling blue of
velvet sky and crystal sea, like that of Algiers,
greeted our enchanted gaze! Like some
of the coast towns of Italy, Charlotte Amalia
is gay with color, and its white, red-roofed
villas nestle among their luxuriant gardens
and tropical foliage, standing out in a perfect
riot of orange and yellow, blue and red.</p>
<p>Never, save in Venice, have I seen such a
gorgeous array of color in a landscape.</p>
<p>Five hours we had in St. Thomas while
the Diana put off hundreds of barrels of
cement; but what with the gayly painted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
boats and their dark-skinned crews, the
naked brown boys diving and swimming for
pennies and dimes in the harbor, a walk to
Bluebeard&#8217;s Tower and Blackbeard&#8217;s Castle,
we were well amused. Particularly so was
Dorothea, who disappeared from my side
for a half-hour while I chatted with the
captain, rejoining me in the tiny palm-bordered
park near the landing.</p>
<p>She was glowing with happiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think, Charlotte?&#8221; she
exclaimed. &#8220;I have a letter from Duke. Not
written after we sailed, of course, for it
couldn&#8217;t have reached me. He bearded
mother in her fortress the morning we left
Washington. She was out, or said she was,
but sent a note saying that I had gone on a
journey and would be absent for a month.
He went directly to the Winthrops for news
and they told him I was with you and that
if he wrote at once by special delivery he
could reach the ship before it left New York
dock. He sent the letter to the captain and
asked him to give it to me at St. Thomas for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
a surprise. The captain is such a nice man,
though a good deal of a tease! Mr. Winthrop
was delighted to hear you were not alone.
Poor Miss Winthrop has influenza and they
both wish they had taken this trip. It seems
they are thinking of it just a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Winthrops coming on this voyage,&#8221;
I exclaimed. &#8220;Impossible! They hadn&#8217;t an
idea of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mightn&#8217;t he want to interview the
governor and look at the island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t time. I chose this journey
instead of another so that I could interview
the governor and look at the islands myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I dare say there&#8217;s nothing in it.
Duke didn&#8217;t speak of it as anything settled,
and he may have misunderstood, his mind
being on me. May I read you the letter&mdash;I
mean parts of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t expect to hear all of it,&#8221; I
replied dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet the bits I leave out are the ones
that show him as he is,&#8221; she said, looking
off into the grove of palms. &#8220;Duke is so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
conscientious that until we succeed in melting
mother&mdash;that would be a good title for
a story, &#8216;Melting Mother&#8217;!&mdash;and until she
sanctions an engagement he won&#8217;t let himself
go, even on paper. So I get only a lovely
sort of &#8216;seepage&#8217; that breaks through in
spite of him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skip the seepage,&#8221; I said unsympathetically,
&#8220;and give the news.&#8221;</p>
<p>She re-read the first paragraphs to herself
with a good deal of dimpling and with
eyes that suffused with feeling now and then,
and turning the page began to read aloud:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Knowing that you were on the high seas far
away from me, though safe with your charming
Miss Clifford (Duke admires you extravagantly,
Charlotte!), I concluded to burn my ships and
have a straightforward talk with your mother,
although you have repeatedly warned me that
this was not the best method of approach and
that only patience would win my cause. I sent
up my card at the New Willard, and doubtless she
would have refused to receive me, but, going from
the office to one of the reception rooms to await
her, I found her seated there with your Philadelphia
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
aunt and another lady. There had evidently
been confidences, so they scented trouble and took
to their heels when I had been introduced to them
somewhat informally as a friend of Dorothea&#8217;s,
my name not being mentioned.</p>
<p>I asked your mother, when we were left alone,
if she had any objection to me other than my uneuphonious
and suggestive surname.</p>
<p>She replied guardedly, no, or at least nothing
in particular, though she might say without conceit
that Dorothea might aspire to anybody, even
the highest.</p>
<p>I cordially agreed, saying that if the male sex
had any eye for beauty, charm or loveliness of
character, Dorothea might marry not only anybody
but everybody.</p>
<p>She said she thought persiflage was out of taste
when the happiness of a mother&#8217;s whole life was
in question.</p>
<p>I begged pardon, but said it was necessary for
me to whistle to keep my courage up, for the happiness
of <i>my</i> whole life was in question.</p>
<p>She said that was beside the point and her
daughter&#8217;s happiness must also be considered.</p>
<p>I remarked that her daughter, to my infinite
surprise and gratitude, assured me that her happiness
lay in the same direction as my own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>She vouchsafed the information that Dorothea
was a romantic fool.</p>
<p>I denied it.</p>
<p>She dealt what she considered to be a body-blow
by affirming that your property would not
be in your hands till you were twenty-one.</p>
<p>I replied that I didn&#8217;t care if it didn&#8217;t reach
you till you were a hundred and twenty-one.</p>
<p>She said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; and asked me if
I had ever thought of changing my name back to
Forrest from Hogg.</p>
<p>I inquired in return if she would mind the loss
of six thousand dollars a year, supposing that I
should take such a step.</p>
<p>She reflected and said that she should, but
she would rather lose it than take the name; and
that we could rub along on Dorothea&#8217;s money,
she supposed, if that was my idea of a pleasant
life.</p>
<p>I hastened to say that I would relinquish the
six thousand without a pang, confident that I
could make a living anyway; but that it would be
disloyal to my good old uncle, whose bounty had
given me a college course, two years at Oxford
and three at Harvard Law School. It had also
permitted me to give my services to the United
States Shipping Board without compensation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>She said she thought it was very selfish in a
government to accept a man&#8217;s whole time and
give him no remuneration; that the Secretary of
the Treasury had only to say to the banks, &#8220;Let
there be money,&#8221; and there was money. There
would be plenty for everybody if only the engravers
and laborers at the Mint would not
strike.</p>
<p>I reminded her that men were remunerated
sufficiently in being allowed to serve their country
in time of war.</p>
<p>She returned that she thought that point of
view foolish and fantastic, but if she found, after
a year, that her daughter&#8217;s peace of mind was
threatened, would I then change my name and
live on Dorothea&#8217;s income until I could establish
myself in the practice of the law? She said that
I must acknowledge that this was a ridiculously
generous proposition and one that neither my
talents nor my station in life merited.</p>
<p>I replied that the proposition meant to me that
I should simply be selling myself and buying her
daughter, and that I declined to accept it.</p>
</div>
<p>(&#8220;Oh, Charlotte!&#8221; the girl interrupted
with a catch in her throat, &#8220;don&#8217;t you think
that was splendid and clever, too?&#8221;)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Your mother said that she wished to take the
matter into consideration during your absence
[so the letter ran on], and just as we were rising
the Philadelphia aunt came in from one door and
General X, Senator Y, and Lord Z from another.</p>
<p>They are at the moment three of the most significant
figures in the moving picture of Washington
society, and all women pursue them. They
beamed at me as if they had been commandeered
for that special purpose, and Senator Y said
jovially: &#8220;How are you, Duke? Glad to see you.
Are you free to dine with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>I hastily turned to your mother, saying: &#8220;I
was just going to ask you and your sister if you
would dine with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord Z, who was at Balliol with me, you remember,
said: &#8220;Then perhaps you will allow us
to come to your table for coffee, Hogg?&#8221; Your
mother gazed at him, astounded that his noble
tongue could utter the name. Then she actually
and gracefully &#8220;fell&#8221; for the dinner, lured by
the bait of the post-prandial coffee with the distinguished
trio, and the Philadelphia aunt kept
things going serenely. She is a delightful person
and will be a perfect companion for your mother
when&mdash;you know when&mdash;when she needs one&mdash;and
I no longer do!</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>(&#8220;There never was a man who said things
like Duke!&#8221; interpolated Dolly ecstatically.)</p>

<p>All would have gone swimmingly to the end
had not a page suddenly entered the room bawling:
&#8220;<i>Mr. Hogg wanted at the telephone: Mr. Hogg?
Telephone message for Mr. HOGG!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Only capitals can give an idea of the volume of
voice. My ear-drum, grown painfully sensitive
since I met your mother, echoed and reëchoed
with the tone as I threaded my way through the
crowded room, followed by every eye, while I
imagined people saying: &#8220;I wonder if he&#8217;s called
to the stockyard?&#8221; (It is queer, but I never felt
this way in Oxford, for they still remember Hogg,
the Scottish poet, and I hung myself to his revered
coat-tails.)</p>
<p>The telephone message was from my secretary,
and healed my wounded vanity, for it came
from the British Embassy conveying the thanks
of the Foreign Office for Mr. Hogg&#8217;s friendly
and helpful action in conducting negotiations for
the chartering of ex-enemy ships lying in South
American ports.</p>
</div>
<p>(&#8220;You see what he is!&#8221; exclaimed Dolly,
looking up from the letter with eyes full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
unshed tears! &#8220;Of course he has five or six
superiors in office but I suppose really that
Duke&#8217;s extraordinary talent keeps that
whole shipping board going! You mark my
words, Charlotte, when Duke gives up his
position and goes to Plattsburg there&#8217;ll be
an absolute slump in that office! But just
hear what follows; it is so discouraging!&#8221;)</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>But when, glowing with the delight that always
comes to me when I have any little tribute to lay
with my love at your charming number-three
feet, when I returned to my table your mother
had gone to her room and the Philadelphia aunt
remained to explain that she had been taken suddenly
ill.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will all come right, Mr.&mdash;my dear boy!&#8221;
she said. &#8220;My sister has one weakness, an abnormal
sensitiveness to public opinion. She thinks
constantly what people will say of this, that, or
the other trifling thing, and in that way perpetually
loses sight of the realities of life. There is a
great deal of good in her that you have never seen
because for the moment she is absolutely obsessed
by her objection to your name and her conviction
that Dorothea might and should marry a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
title. My sister married Reginald Valentine more
for the effect on her future visiting-card than anything
else, but Dorothea&#8217;s father bequeathed his
good looks, his sunny disposition, his charm, and
his generous nature to his daughter. You have
chosen wisely, my dear Mr.&mdash;boy, but not more
wisely, to my mind, than Dorothea has!&#8221;</p>
<p>So it ended, but I somehow hope that I may
have converted your mother from an enemy alien
to an armed neutral!</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing more of&mdash;of&mdash;general
interest,&#8221; said Dolly tearfully, as she slipped
the letter in the envelope. &#8220;Aunt Maggie is a
trump. Oh, Charlotte! if only you had ever
had a love-problem like mine and could
advise me! Duke always wondered that you
never married.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Dorothea ought to be cuffed for impertinence,
but she is too unconscious and too
pretty and lovable for corporal punishment.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps there may still be hope even at
thirty!&#8221; I said stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean that! You might
have anybody by lifting your finger! We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
only wonder you&#8217;ve never lifted it! But you
could be happy only with a very learned
and prominent man, you are so clever!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m clever enough to prefer love to
learning, if I have to choose, Dolly, my
dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry you didn&#8217;t get a letter,
Charlotte,&#8221; said the girl, snuggling sympathetically
to my side on the bench.</p>
<p>This was more than flesh and blood or
angel could bear!</p>
<p>I kissed her, and, shaking her off my
shoulder vigorously, I said, as I straightened
my hat: &#8220;As a matter of fact, Miss
Valentine, I have had a letter every day since
we left New York; a letter delivered before
breakfast by the steward. You have had but
one, yet you are twenty and I am thirty!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Charlotte!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t add to your impudence by being
too astonished, darling,&#8221; I continued.
&#8220;Come! let&#8217;s go and pick bananas and pineapples
and tamarinds and shaddocks and
star-apples and sapodillas!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t budge a step till you tell me all
about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll grow to this green bench
and have to be cut away by your faithful
Marmaduke!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a secret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t exist at all for you. You are
not of age, Dolly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m old enough to know the things one
can learn by heart!&#8221; was Dolly&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>When the Diana was leaving St. Thomas
at sunset and we were well on our way to
St. Croix, Dolly made a half confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not my chaperon, Charlotte,
because in my hour of need I simply fastened
myself to you like a limpet, or an albatross,
or a barnacle, or any other form of nautical
vampire that you prefer. Still, I might as
well confess that I cabled to Duke, or wirelessed,
or did something awfully expensive
of that sort at St. Thomas while you were
having that interminable talk with the
captain, who, by the way, is married and
devoted to his wife, they say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That was foolish and extravagant, my
child,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you
said, but I have the most absolute confidence
in your indiscretion. I hope you remembered
that all messages are censored in war-time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, indeed,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;I was never
so hampered and handicapped in my life,
but I think I have outwitted the censors. I
wish I were as sure about&mdash;mother!&#8221;</p>

<div class='ra'>
<p><i>S.S. Diana, January</i> 26</p>
</div>

<p>St. Croix was delightful, with a motor-ride
across the island from Frederikstad to
Christianstad, where we lunched.</p>
<p>Dolly&#8217;s mind is not in a state especially
favorable for instruction, but I took a guidebook,
and, sitting under a wonderful tamarind
tree, read her Alexander Hamilton&#8217;s
well-known letter describing a West Indian
hurricane, written from St. Croix in 1772.</p>
<p>We were with a party of Canadian acquaintances
made on shipboard and greatly
interested in our first visits to sugar plantations.
Vast cane-fields of waving green
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
stretched mile after mile on the right and
on the left, making it seem incredible that
a Food Commissioner need beg the sweet
tooth to deny itself in the midst of such
riotous plenty.</p>
<p>There was a dazzling glare from the
white buildings of the town and the coral
roads, but the moment we reached the outlying
country all was verdant and restful.
The beautiful hard roads ran like white
ribbons over velvet hills and through rich
valleys; tall windmills, belonging to the
earlier days of sugar-making, rose picturesquely
from the magnificent palms and
other shade-trees; there were brilliant flowers
and blossoming vines breaking through
hedges here and there, and acres of pineapples
and orange groves. Truly, our Canadian
companions might wish us luck in our
new possessions!</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<div class='ra'>
<p><i>Later in the day</i></p>
</div>

<p>We have left the Virgin Islands now and
at dawn we neared St. Kitts, of the Leeward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
group, anchoring a half-mile away from the
landing and putting passengers ashore in
the small boats that ranged themselves
near the steamer. There was a very bedlam
of chatter, argument, and recrimination
among the black boatmen, mounting at
times to furious invective in a patois we
failed wholly to understand, for though the
majority of the natives speak English on
all the islands, whether Dutch, French, or
British, they use a language of their own
vintage on these undress occasions. I could
see Dolly&#8217;s bright head and laughing eyes
peeping through her porthole, nodding good-morning
to me as I viewed the scene from
my own little stateroom opposite hers.</p>
<p>The St. Kitts boatmaster was a superb
personage in white linen uniform and cap.
He stood at the top of the steps lowered
from our steamer to the ocean, and from
that serene height of power commanded
his clamorous and refractory legions.</p>
<p>It was his voice that called me irresistibly
from my berth and kept my ears, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
well as my eyes, glued to the porthole of my
cabin. It was a deep, rich barytone, as full
of color as his own native skies and sea.
The white cap set off his dark skin, and a
pair of eyes that shot lightnings of authority
gleamed from under his vizor. He ought to
have been singing the &#8220;Pagliacci&#8221; prologue
at the Metropolitan Opera House, but instead
he was calling resonantly (his private
megaphone seemed to be located in his own
throat): &#8220;<i>Don&#8217;t crowd, Edward.... Push
in, Victoria.... Get away, George.... Come
nearer, come nearer, Mary.... Show your
number, Albert, or meet me in court to-morrow
at eleven!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, these were the names
painted on the boats crowding and jamming
their way to the most favorable places for
securing passengers or freight; but the
quality of his voice made it seem as if, in
calling Victoria, Edward, George, Mary, and
Albert, he were summoning a corporeal
bevy of kings and queens to do his instant
bidding. The excitement reached its climax
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
when an aged bishop descended the stairway,
which was under some circumstances as perilous
as a ladder. The bishop&#8217;s quaint hat
and gown and hood of various colors made
him seem like a benign figure in comic opera;
and perhaps because of his dignity or his
multiplicity of luggage, all the boats ardently
desired him as a passenger. Two green boxes,
carrying much information painted in white
on the sides, gave us all details of his rank,
ancestry, and place of residence. These
were projected down the stairway and then
followed an imposing procession of servitors
bearing potted plants, packages done up in
linen cloth, baskets of eggs, limes, lemons,
grapefruit, a canary in a cage, some white
mice, and a Persian cat; the last three, it is
needless to say, being in separate crates.</p>
<p>Majestic being, that St. Kitts boatmaster;
never more impressive than when he successfully
landed a bishop of the isles! Dolly
and I recalled the &#8220;Admirable Crichton&#8221;
in Barrie&#8217;s whimsical play, who, as butler
in a titled English family, was wrecked with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
the entire household on a desert island. It
needed only the emergencies of twenty-four
hours to establish him as the dominant intellectual
force and the practical governor
of the sadly inefficient earls, countesses,
ladies, and honorables; and before long he
assumed the authority properly belonging
to him. That the earl&#8217;s daughter finally fell
in love with him seemed not so much dramatic
license as a tribute to his obvious superiority.
In London the lady would have been
criticized as marrying beneath her; on the
desert island it actually appeared as if she
were doing particularly well for herself;
indeed, Dolly confessed that though she
would prefer marrying Marmaduke Hogg
she would rather be wrecked in the company
of the St. Kitts boatmaster.</p>

<p><i>S.S. Diana, Sunday, January 27</i></p>
</div>

<p>After breakfast, on our way to anchor at
Antigua for the night, we saw in the distance
the towering cone of Nevis, the &#8220;Gorgeous
Isle&#8221; of Alexander Hamilton&#8217;s birth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
and the famous scene of Lord Nelson&#8217;s
marriage. It has fallen from its proud estate
of former years into poverty and neglect,
but it is still marvelously beautiful to the
eye. We sat on deck reading, or at least
glancing drowsily over the pages of our
books to the sapphire sea and the emerald
forests of the island shores with a never-ceasing
delight. There were three Roman
Catholic priests on board, also four Protestant
missionaries, one of them with a wife
and a family of charming children&mdash;Samuel,
Naomi, Esther, Daniel. Piously they were
named and never once did they bring contempt
on the Holy Scriptures! From below
in a far end of the boat we could hear echoes
of gospel hymns in some little cabin where
a Sunday-morning service was being held.</p>
<p>Dorothea gave a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all so peaceful, Charlotte! One day
just like another and all beautiful and tranquil.
We haven&#8217;t seen anybody hurry since
we left New York. Do you remember Rudyard
Kipling saying, when he came back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
there after a long absence, that he was afraid
to step slowly lest the man behind him
should walk up his back? Nobody ever
seems nervous in these islands. The natives
can be ragged and hungry without being
much concerned. Work never appears to be
a delight to them for its own sake, but only
as a means to get food. I feel slip&mdash;slip&mdash;slipping
into a heavenly state of coma. Does
anything ever stir the tropics except hurricanes
and earthquakes, I wonder? How can
women fight for suffrage in this climate?
How can a man be awakened to great ambitions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alexander Hamilton was born on Nevis
and passed all his boyhood and youthful
days on what is now our own St. Croix,&#8221; I
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but he wasn&#8217;t Washington&#8217;s aide-de-camp
nor secretary of the treasury in the
tropics!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True; nevertheless, when he was Nicholas
Cruger&#8217;s bookkeeper at the age of
twelve he wrote to an American friend: &#8216;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
contemn the groveling condition of a clerk
to which my fortunes condemn me, and I
would willingly risk my life, though not
my character, to exalt my station.... My
youth excludes me from any hope of immediate
preferment, but I mean to prepare the
way for futurity.&#8217; You see the yeast was
stirring, even in the tropics, Dolly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I feel no yeast stirring in me,&#8221; she
said languidly. &#8220;All the morning I have been
trying to recapture a certain &#8216;Ode to a Cow&#8217;
written by a man of action in a country hotel
where mother and I were sojourning last
summer. I could have echoed it when I first
regarded the inhabitants of these islands,
and now anybody might say it of me, for I
grow more and more cow-like with every
passing day. It runs this way:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<p  style='text-align: center;'>&#8220;&#8216;ODE TO A CUD-CHEWING COW</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Get up and moo! Tear round and quit thy dreams!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>By this time Dorothea was asleep. Her
book slid to the floor, I shaded her face with
my green umbrella, pulled down her muslin
frock over her pretty ankles, and gave myself
up to vagrant thoughts of her probable
future.</p>
<p>Sunday on shipboard is a good day for
reflections and heart-searchings. My own
problem, after all, is not so baffling as Dolly&#8217;s.
She is as loyal as a charming and sensible
girl can be to a mother like Mrs. Valentine,
whose soul, if the truth were told, is about
the size of a mustard-seed. A frivolous, useless,
bird-minded woman is Dolly&#8217;s mother;
a woman pecking at life as a canary pecks
at its cuttlefish, simply to sharpen its bill.
How the girl can respect her I cannot
imagine! I suppose flesh calls to flesh and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
she loves her without too much analysis,
but they seem to have come to the parting
of the ways. It is Dolly&#8217;s highest self that is
in love with Marmaduke Hogg, and I don&#8217;t
believe she will sacrifice it to a maternal
whim and call it filial obedience. Perhaps
the absence that makes the heart grow
fonder is working like a philter in this
journey planned by Mrs. Valentine with a
far different purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her go with you, Charlotte,&#8221; she
begged me with tears in her eyes. &#8220;I must
get her away from this attractive but undesirable
young man! That absurd uncle
who didn&#8217;t want his name to die out must
have been a lunatic or an imbecile. Why
shouldn&#8217;t such a vulgar name become extinct?
And to think that my exquisite
Dorothea&mdash;whose figure and eyelashes
have been remarked by royalty&mdash;to think
that she should be expected to graft herself
on to that family tree of all others! To think
that she may take that name herself and, for
aught we know, add half a dozen more to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
the list; all boys, probably, who would marry
in course of time and produce others, piling
Hoggs on Hoggs, as it were! It is like one of
those horrible endless chains that are condemned
by the government!&#8221;</p>
<p>I gave way to peals of laughter at this
impassioned speech, evidently annoying
Mrs. Valentine, who expected sympathy.
I tried to placate her with reference to the
poet of the name which had none but delightful
associations in Scotland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if they choose to defy me and
marry each other, let them go and live in
Scotland!&#8221; she snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you have minded Dolly&#8217;s marrying
Lord Bacon?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>This gave her food for thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said reflectively, &#8220;for, of
course, he was a lord, which is something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about the associations?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t explain, but somehow they are
not as repulsive to me,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;I
always think of bacon cooked, not raw, and&mdash;the
other is alive!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>As for my own difficulty, it is, after all,
a conventional one. I cannot bear the idea
of marrying my employer; a man known
by sight and reputation to everybody in
Washington, while I am a relatively unknown
person without fortune, kith, or kin.
The thought brings to mind sensational
headlines in cheap newspapers regarding the
wedding of some aged millionaire with his
youthful stenographer, and the consequent
alarms of his household; or the alliance of
some scion of a wealthy house with a trained
nurse of obscure lineage and vaulting ambition.
I am all alone in the world, and
though my father, who died when he was
only five and twenty, left me but the barest
support, I have gloried in my independence
and rejoiced in my modest successes.</p>
<p>My people on both sides were of good
stock. Even the Winthrops could climb my
family tree and find no bad fruit on it,
but the world will say: &#8220;What a splendid
match for Charlotte Clifford.&#8221; ... &#8220;I wonder
how Ellen Winthrop will take it?&#8221; ...
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have thought Clive Winthrop
would marry his secretary, somehow, though
there&#8217;s nothing against her; but he could
look higher!&#8221;</p>
<p>The world would be quite right. It is a
splendid marriage for Charlotte Clifford,
and Clive Winthrop could look higher. He
is my superior and that is the reason I love
him. That he loves me proves that there is
something in me that will rise to his level.
All the same, I wrote him when I came away
that I could never cross the bridge between
us (there is a bridge, although he does not
see it) until I was no longer his secretary
and until I was sure his sister would welcome
me into the household that has been so
harmonious and delightful to every human
being that has ever crossed its threshold.
Nobody could equal Ellen Winthrop as a
hostess, with her fine, spirited face, lovely
even at seventy; her gift of repartee, her
stately manner, her simple, trailing dress,
always of black or gray, and always reaching
the floor, when most of the feminine world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
looks, in its best clothes, as if mounted on
stilts, with a skimpy, semi-detached tail
wriggling its silly length behind! I could
never scale the heights on which the splendid
Ellen perpetually dwells, but I could sit at
the foot of them and admire with all my
heart, and perhaps that attitude, if fully
understood, might win her affection.</p>

<p><i>S.S. Diana, January 28, 1918</i></p>
</div>

<p>At Antigua we anchored and took a steam
launch to see the town, where we visited a
very fine sugar-cane factory, watching the
whole process from the cane-field to the
market.</p>
<p>We did not land at Guadeloupe, the hour
not being favorable and the stay being too
brief to compensate for the effort involved.
But this morning at eight we approached
Dominica, the largest of the Leeward group,
the loftiest of the Lesser Antilles, and the
loveliest&mdash;if one could or ought to make
comparison&mdash;the loveliest of the West
Indian Isles. The guidebook calls it &#8220;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
Caribbean Wonderland,&#8221; and Dolly and
I were not disposed to quarrel with the
phrase, after hanging over the deck-rail
for an hour before breakfast and marveling
at the beauty of the view. Mountains shimmered
in the distance like visions seen in
dreams, mountains like towering emeralds
springing from a sapphire sea! We passed
tiny hamlets, half-hidden in lime orchards,
and cocoa-groves with yellow patches of
cane gleaming here and there against a
background of forest. As we drew nearer
we could see white torrents dashing tempestuously
down through green valleys, for
Dominica has a too plenteous water-supply,
since in some districts three hundred inches
a year is the average rainfall. It rained seven
times in the three hours that we passed on
shore, but the showers were gentle ones, and
we found generous shelter in the wonderful
Botanical Garden, where we spent most of
our time.</p>
<p>Nature is sometimes a kindly mother;
often she wears a tragic mask, and now and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
then she indulges in melodrama; but I never
conceived the possibility of her having a
sense of humor until we witnessed her freakish
mood in the Dominica garden. There
were the usual varieties of magnificent palms
and brilliant flowering shrubs; but the joy
of joys was the Sausage-Tree, around which
we walked in helpless mirth at the incredible
veracity of the imitation. It reached a goodly
height, and had a splendid girth and circumference
of shade; but no factory in
Bologna or Frankfort, or any other possible
birthplace of the real article, could rival
this amazing, this funny, tree in fertility.
Its product was just a trifle large, save for
the omnivorous lover of sausage; but in
other respects it was a faithful copy of the
original&mdash;unless, indeed, the first sausage-maker
borrowed the idea from the tree, instead
of the other way about. These vegetable
sausages hung in hundreds of strings
and festoons and clusters from the topmost
to the lowest branches. Because of the way
they hung, the way they were strung, their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
shape and color, and the very manner in
which the skin was neatly drawn over each
one and fastened, no one possessing a sense
of the ridiculous but would sit down under
the tree and laugh at the joke. Oddly enough
we could find no pictorial postcard of this
phenomenon to bring home for the enlivening
of winter evenings, though we bought a
capital one of the Cannon-Ball Tree, just as
unique in its way but not so absurd.</p>
<p>Dorothea was enchanted with Dominica,
and kept exclaiming every few minutes:
&#8220;Oh, if only Great Britain would sell us
this island! I think I&#8217;d choose to live in
Dominica, because if I had a sausage-tree
in my garden I should laugh every day, and
the children wouldn&#8217;t need any playthings.&#8221;</p>

<p><i> S.S. Diana, February 1, 1918</i></p>
</div>

<p>We have had a glimpse of France through
a day at Martinique. The principal feature
of our visit was a wild motor-drive up an
eighteen-hundred-foot mountain. It was a
steady climb from glory to glory, with tropical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
forests on every side. Our method of
progress was not quite serene, for there was
not a sufficient number of cars to satisfy the
demand.</p>
<p>After a long wait Dolly and I took a
small mongrel sort of motor that had been
refused by all the Diana&#8217;s passengers. The
Creole driver, handsome, debonair, persuasive,
and fluent, though unintelligible, assured
us that he had ascended and descended
the mountain hundreds of times, a fact only
too obvious to one who examined his means
of transportation. None of the tires matched,
and two of them looked like wounded
soldiers just home from the front, displaying
patches of adhesive plaster and bandages
of cotton and woolen rags of every
color, with an occasional inset of an alien
material into the rubber. One could catch
a glimpse of a tin tomato-can neatly introduced
in the place of some vital bit of
machinery; a Waterbury alarm-clock figured
in an unexpected position, apparently adding
its power to the engine; and there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
stout ropes, here and there, which I never
observed before in the rigging of any motor.</p>
<p>I hesitated to enter, for the future, though
not absolutely certain, looked full of hope
and promise; but Dolly was firm and reckless.
I am ten years her senior, but still
young to be called a &#8220;&#8217;fraid cat&#8221; with impunity;
so I finally mounted the vehicle.
The driver gave a gay, insouciant tap to a
front tire, as much as to say: &#8220;Courage,
mon enfant! C&#8217;est la dernière fois!&#8221;&mdash;then
flung himself into his seat, and, blowing a
horn, started his base-hospital up the mountain
at a breakneck pace. The motor&#8217;s own
horn was out of commission, but there was a
substitute by the driver&#8217;s side. It was easy
for him to blow it because he had no particular
use for either of his hands, his steering
being left largely to chance. Repeated expostulations
in boarding-school French only
elicited a reply that sounded like: &#8220;Soyez
tranquilles, mesdames. You speak American?
Bien! Leezy est parfaitement docile!&#8221;</p>
<p>This conveyed no idea to me, although
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
his broad grin convinced me that in his
own opinion it was a subtle witticism. At
length, however, it burst upon Dolly, who
went off into irrepressible gales of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have lived so continuously in a
rarefied Winthrop atmosphere, Charlotte,
that you haven&#8217;t any modern vocabulary.
He is telling you the pet name of his car, to
give you confidence. Nobody ever dies in a
tin &#8216;Lizzie.&#8217; Not only is the machine indestructible,
but the people that ride in it.
Isn&#8217;t the driver a witty, reckless darling?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was, indeed; and, incredible as it may
seem, Lizzie ascended and descended the
mountain in safety&mdash;though only because
a kind Providence watched over us. Then,
when we had paid the reckless, danger-proof
darling twice the sum he should have demanded,
we sat on a bench in the Savanna,
where we could be quietly grateful that we
were alive and watch the coming and going
of the Fort-de-France townspeople, so unmistakably
French, with the bright costumes
of the women, the pose of their turbans or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
hats, their sparkle and chatter and vivacious
gestures.</p>
<p>Here in the Savanna travelers always
gather to look at the marble statue of the
Empress Josephine, which is called the
greatest work of art in the West Indies.
That is not fatuous praise, perhaps, but the
figure needed the hand of no master sculptor
to hold the eye and captivate the imagination.
It is mounted on a huge pedestal
and is of heroic size, the white glitter of its
marble enhanced by its truly magnificent
setting, a circle of towering royal palms.
There she stands, the lovely Creole woman
of Martinique, forever looking at &#8220;Trois
Islets,&#8221; as if she were remembering her
birth in an overseer&#8217;s shack and her girlhood
passed in a sugar-mill. Straightway the
crowds of native men and women chaffering
in the market-place, the mothers holding
up their crowing babies to the statue, the
nursemaids and groups of playing children,
all vanished, and we re-lived in spirit poor
Josephine&#8217;s past, thrilling anew at the remembrance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
of her romance, her triumph,
and her bitter sorrow&mdash;the Creole girl who
crossed the sea to become Empress of France
and share a throne with Napoleon, but who
sailed back to her island home a brokenhearted
woman.</p>
<p>Good-bye, Martinique, land of Josephine;
and land of St. Pierre, the scene of one
of the greatest tragedies of modern times,
when the fury of Mont Pelée engulfed the
growth of centuries and buried forty thousand
human creatures in its scalding lava.
St. Lucia, of the Windward group, to-morrow,
and then Barbados, from whence the
Diana goes on to Demerara and returns
a week or so later, so that we are able to
rejoin her, taking up our former comfortable
cabins and our much-liked captain.</p>

<p>Here we are again on our homeward trip,
making fewer landings and briefer stops,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
principally to take on passengers and thousands
of barrels of limes.</p>
<p>Barbados, with its charming hotel at
Hastings, was an unalloyed delight; and
Dorothea, who had determined to live in
each of the islands as it came along, would
finally have transferred her allegiance for
good and all had it not seemed more loyal
for an American to choose one of our own
possessions and &#8220;grow up with the country.&#8221;
We found ourselves in the midst of pleasant,
even distinguished, society&mdash;British officials,
ex-governors, and judge-advocates of
the various islands, English and Canadian
soldiers on sick-leave, and officers commanding
the U-boat chasers in near-by waters.
Dorothea danced nightly and held court
daily on the broad piazzas, reminding me
of Rudyard Kipling&#8217;s fascinating heroine
in an Indian army post, who, whenever she
appeared, caused the horizon to become
black with majors. Her head and heart remained
true to the absent Marmaduke&mdash;I
am not so sure about her dancing feet!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>Now that that experience is over, with
the many others, we are at sea and quiet
again, with one tranquil day just like the
other.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a honeymoon journey it would
make, Charlotte!&#8221; said Dolly one moonlight
evening on deck. &#8220;It is so difficult to
grow in knowledge of people in New York
or Washington. One doesn&#8217;t even know
one&#8217;s self.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All journeys must be good for honeymooners,
don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in a way; but some places are
created for lovers and newlyweds, who are,
after all, only explorers, Charlotte, forever
discovering new lands and annexing new
territories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and sometimes falling into the
hands of savages and cannibals, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that must be terrible&mdash;the awakening
to find that one has been mistaken in
a man!&#8221; sighed Dolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say we ought to worry lest men be
mistaken in us; it might happen, you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your mind is so logical, Charlotte!
However, this voyage wouldn&#8217;t have to be
idealized to meet the needs of honeymooners.
In a Vermont village where I sometimes stay
I remember a girl who had to be married
on Sunday because she could not give up
her position as telegraph-operator till Saturday
night. That was dull enough in all conscience,
but she was married in her high-school
graduating dress, and went to her
grandmother&#8217;s house, ten miles away, for
her wedding-journey. I think it required
considerable inward felicity to exalt that
situation!&#8221;</p>
<p>I sat upright in my steamer chair. &#8220;Dorothea,&#8221;
I said sharply, &#8220;you have been
manufacturing conversation for the last five
minutes&mdash;just killing time for fear that I
should ask you questions. Is there anything
on your mind? You have been absentminded
and nervous for days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your imagination is working overtime,
Charlotte,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;We are nearing
home, that is all; and life presses closer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>I could not gainsay her, for every mile
of ocean crossed makes my heart beat
faster. I seem to be living just now in a
sort of pause between my different lives.
There is the heaven of my childhood in
the vague background; then the building of
my &#8220;career,&#8221; if so modest a thing can be
called by so shining a name; then the steady,
half-conscious growth of a love that illumines
my labors, yet makes them difficult
and perplexing; and now there is a sense of
suspended activity, of waiting, with a glimmering
air-castle rising like an iridescent
bubble out of the hazy future. Sometimes
there are two welcoming faces at a window
and sometimes the indistinct figure of a
woman stretching out a forbidding hand,
my chief&#8217;s sister, who may not want a third
person in the family!</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<div class='ra'>
<p><i>S.S. Diana, February 13, 1918</i></p>
</div>

<p>Dolly went on the bridge this afternoon
and stayed a half-hour with the captain,
giving no reason save that she liked to talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
with him, which seemed plausible, but did
not satisfy me. At bedtime I discovered her
unpacking and laying out in her upper berth
a dazzling toilet for our landing at St.
Thomas to-morrow. She blushed when I
looked in upon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do dress &#8216;up to me,&#8217; Charlotte,&#8221; she
coaxed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be conspicuous.
Wear your gray georgette and the broad hat
with the roses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why this sudden display of vanity and
good clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t your letter of introduction to
Governor Oliver brought us an invitation
to luncheon at Government House?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but I don&#8217;t suppose it is a banquet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlotte, I must confide in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think it was about time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known for days that you were
concealing something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to be secretive, but I
thought it was only fair to you to keep my
own counsel. Now you can report to mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
that you knew nothing, and that therefore
you couldn&#8217;t interfere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what have you done? You can&#8217;t
be secretly married&mdash;with your chosen
man in Washington and you on the vasty
deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I&#8217;m next door to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;next door&#8217;?
Have you a groom and a minister waiting
on the New York dock?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; mother will be there, but I fear
she won&#8217;t bring a minister. I&#8217;m so glad
you imagined something far, far worse
than I ever intended. It shows that you
are more audacious than I&mdash;though nobody
would believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like your tone; but go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been communicating rather frequently
with Duke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I fancied, from your changing money
at every stop and doing continual sums on
paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has made me a pauper&mdash;this telegraphing
in war-time. The messages go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
by Jamaica or Porto Rico or Trinidad or
Bermuda and lots of other islands, and I
think some of the messages must be personally
conducted straight to New York by
powerful swimmers, judging by the cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on. Don&#8217;t temporize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I needn&#8217;t repeat all of them, and in
fact I haven&#8217;t copies. Duke, after he had
my first telegram from St. Thomas, wired
back to St. Croix, &#8216;<i>You are willing to take
my name. Why, after all, shouldn&#8217;t I refuse
your sacrifice and make one of my own by
taking yours?</i>&#8217; Wasn&#8217;t that noble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have softened the heart of a
suffragette or a feminist. What did you
reply?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said: &#8216;<i>Never in the world!</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never&#8217; would have been enough. You
wasted three words at a dollar or so apiece.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to be strong. I said: &#8216;<i>Never in
the world! I am not going to have you criticized
and nagged and made unhappy, as if your
name were a crime!</i>&#8217; Then he wired: &#8216;<i>But it
would remove objections, and cost only six
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
thousand a year.</i>&#8217; I had to wait two whole
days and nights before I could cable: &#8216;<i>Objector
will surely meet me in New York. She
will probably forgive if we are both firm. My
mind is made up. I would rather be a you-know-what
than remain a Valentine.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was strong enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant it to be. He has been scurrilously
treated, and somebody must stand by him.
Now, to-morrow, February 14th, is his
birthday. I remember it because we met
on St. Valentine&#8217;s day, and it wasn&#8217;t many
hours afterward that I guessed how he felt
about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorothea! Do you mean to tell me that
a man spoke to you of his feelings within
twenty-four hours of the time you met?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I do not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly intimated as much. If it
wasn&#8217;t many hours after you met on the
14th it must have been on the 15th.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you are wrong, Charlotte. It was
the evening of the same day. We met in the
early morning.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like a children&#8217;s party with an
exchange of those snapping-mottoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duke is nearly twenty-eight, you know,
Charlotte; so it is simply nonsense to jeer
at him. You ought to be able to imagine
what sort of things would be said between
two persons mutually attracted to each
other&mdash;when you remember that he was
born on February 14th and my name is
Valentine. The coincidence simply put ideas
into our heads; but I won&#8217;t go on if you
don&#8217;t sympathize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t actually disapprove, not at
heart. Now, what has his birthday got to
do with to-morrow and St. Thomas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I cabled him as soon as we arrived
at Barbados: &#8216;<i>What would you like
for a birthday present from the West Indies?</i>&#8217;
I knew that he would remember we met on
St. Valentine&#8217;s day and an answer could
reach me at St. Thomas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you buy him a souvenir without
inquiring at great expense what he&#8217;d
prefer?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es; but I thought it was a nice, affectionate
question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he cabled one word, Charlotte.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guessed that the moment you quoted
your message. When you asked: &#8216;<i>What shall
I bring you from the West Indies?</i>&#8217; Duke
promptly answered, &#8216;<i>Yourself.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlotte, you are positively uncanny!
How did you manage to hit upon it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t take as much intellect as you
fancy. You are as transparent as a plate of
glass. Well, when he said &#8216;<i>Yourself</i>,&#8217; how did
you answer him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only thing I don&#8217;t like to tell
you, but I must. I reflected a full half-hour
at Barbados. It was one of those
heavenly moonlight nights not suitable for
reflection. Then I wrote a message and sent
it to the office by one of the colored waiters
so that the hotel people shouldn&#8217;t read
it. It said&#8221; (and here she turned her face
away from me): &#8220;&#8216;<i>Deliveries from the West
Indies are uncertain and expensive; come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
and get me.</i>&#8217;&mdash;Do you think that was forward?&#8221;</p>
<p>I laughed irresistibly and a long time.
&#8220;It certainly was not backward, but it was
delicious,&#8221; I said at length, wiping the tears
from my eyes. &#8220;However, he seems as impetuous
and tempestuous as you, so perhaps
it doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Charlotte, I knew that probably
he couldn&#8217;t meet this boat to save his
life, so I was willing to say, &#8216;<i>Come and get
me</i>,&#8217; just for fun. I hadn&#8217;t the slightest clue
as to when he would receive my message
or the sailing dates of steamers from New
York, everything is so changed in war-times.
I know only that the time is slipping away,
and Duke may leave the Shipping Board at
any moment for the training-camp. I intend
to have one brief, straightforward talk with
mother, and declare my purpose. We are
going to get your Mr. Winthrop to intercede
for us, too. I shall be of age in March,
and I don&#8217;t intend to let a mere name stand
between me and happiness.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are right, and that your
mother will finally agree with you; but I
still don&#8217;t see the need of an unusual toilet
for to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for the Governor,&#8221; said Dolly, &#8220;and
one never knows what may happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If a bromidic remark may also be cryptic,
Dorothea, you have achieved the combination.
Now I must ask you a direct question,
for, although I am not your keeper, but
your friend, I am not disposed to let you do
anything reckless. Why did you put that
idea into Duke&#8217;s head&mdash;the idea of meeting
you in St. Thomas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to talk things over before
seeing mother. I knew I could trust him.
He has some elderly cousins and a sister-in-law;
surely, between them, he could
find somebody to bring along with him;
and I have you, safest and wisest of Charlottes!
Duke is one of the legal advisers
of the Shipping Board. Why shouldn&#8217;t he
have business in these islands? Besides, it
is a practical impossibility that he should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
be able to reach St. Thomas on a given
date.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did you suggest it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Charlotte, it must have been
empty-mindedness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I regard it as a pure lack of self-control.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve practiced self-control for one whole,
endless year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have practiced filial obedience, I
grant that. But what good do you expect
to achieve if Duke does surmount the insurmountable
and meet you to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What good?&#8221; Dolly almost shrieked the
question. &#8220;What good, do you ask? You
callous, cold-hearted Charlotte! Why, four
heavenly days spent in his society, to be
sure&mdash;with you and his chaperon having
a lovely time together somewhere not too
near.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t any sneaking idea
of marrying him in St. Thomas? Because
I won&#8217;t allow it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck! He wouldn&#8217;t let me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
unless mother&#8217;s attitude has been miraculously
changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can only say that you have
made me very nervous and uncomfortable,
Dolly,&#8221; and I prepared to leave her cabin
and cross the narrow space that divided it
from mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darling Charlotte!&#8221; Here she drew me
back. &#8220;If you are nervous and uncomfortable,
it seems that you think there&#8217;s a bare
chance that Duke will be in St. Thomas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know nothing about the possibilities,&#8221;
I replied. &#8220;He might persuade the Shipping
Board that he could be of use in this vicinity,
and, of course, he would have advantages
not possessed by ordinary tourists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had had any experience with
shipping boards, Charlotte, you would
know that they can only be moved by
chloroform or dynamite. Besides, Duke
would never do anything underhanded; he
is too patriotic; though, of course, he is
inventive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! And inventiveness is only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
one of his gifts, while his virtues are those
of Sir Galahad, King Arthur, Marcus
Aurelius, Abraham Lincoln, and a few
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlotte, I don&#8217;t want to seem harsh,
but I hope some time you will get a faint
inkling of what love really is. Your heart
reminds me of the Rock of Gibraltar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One doesn&#8217;t wear the Rock of Gibraltar
on one&#8217;s sleeve, at all events,&#8221; I remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that if you ever did have
a love-affair you wouldn&#8217;t confide in me,
when I adore you so, Charlotte?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean something of the sort, my child.&#8221;
At which she made a feint of beating me
with her little silver hair-brush, but ended
in kissing my cheek and whispering: &#8220;Good-night!
You are a darling, even if you have
no sentiment.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Morning came. We anchored outside St.
Croix at five o&#8217;clock; went through medical
inspection at six, and if there was anything
the matter with Dolly&#8217;s heart or mine the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
physician did not offer any comment. Then
about ten we approached St. Thomas for
the second time.</p>
<p>If the Virgin Islands looked beautiful
when we first saw them, they had grown
in beauty during our brief absence, and
my birthplace, in the shining distance, was
a very dream of loveliness. We saw its outline
rising above a rim of azure sea, with
the mountains of Porto Rico standing out
to the westward. The great palm groves on
the shore led the eye upward to the green
hills and the clouds topping the higher
peaks. Gayly painted boats began to come
near the Diana, and naked diving boys,
slender shapes of brown mahogany, plunged
into the sea to catch our pennies. Then we
saw the red roofs of Charlotte Amalia, the
little park near the landing, and the pink,
toy-like fortress with the Stars and Stripes
floating over it.</p>
<p>Dorothea and I stood near the deck-rail,
her hand in mine. In her white dress, her
broad hat wreathed with corn-flowers, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
a scarlet sunshade, she looked a youthful
Columbia, so radiant and bewitching that
for the first time I secretly hoped Marmaduke
Hogg might triumph over the obstacles
in the way and come to meet his ladylove,
although I saw many embarrassing
and awkward situations arising from such a
meeting. I could not be jealous of so bright
and joyous a creature, and anyway my own
happiness was only a few days distant, if I
chose to put out my arms and take it.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a crowd on the dock,
which was made most unattractive by a
colossal mountain of coal that concealed
everything behind it. The Diana made a
slow approach, but we finally passed the
coal-heap and came within thirty feet of the
shore. I could feel Dolly&#8217;s heart beat through
her pulse that lay under my hand. Then
suddenly her quick eyes searched the outer
edge of the crowd and found the shape they
were looking for.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I see him! I think I am going to
faint, for I didn&#8217;t really expect him! Yes;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
I know it is he, though he is wearing summer
clothes that I never saw before. Look, Charlotte!
Away back near that grove of cocoanut-trees!
He&#8217;s with other people&mdash;I knew
he would find somebody! Give me the
glasses. There&#8217;s an elderly man in a Panama
hat, and two ladies, and&mdash;why, Charlotte,
take the glasses yourself. It can&#8217;t be, but it
looks like your Winthrop!&#8221;</p>
<p>My hand trembled so that I could hardly
hold the glass. I could scarcely believe Dolly&#8217;s
eyes or my own; but the Diana crept nearer,
and it was true! Inch by inch the picture
grew clearer, and then a pathetic surprise
met my gaze.</p>
<p>I could see Clive plainly now, and felt that
he was searching the line of passengers on
the Diana&#8217;s deck to find me. My heart gave
a furious leap to think that a man like my
chief would look for only one woman&#8217;s face
in that crowd, and regard it, with all its
blemishes, as a precious thing.</p>
<p>Duke had separated himself from the
little group and was swinging his hat to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
Dorothea; but I could not explain why the
two men were not standing nearer together
and what was the meaning of the wheeled
chair, with the nurse&#8217;s head rising above
the back. The identity of the person in the
chair was hidden by a tiny black frilled
parasol with a handle bent in the middle so
that it could be used for a shield. Did I know
that little old-fashioned sunshade? I did! It
was the property of some one whose belongings
had a certain air of difference from
those of other people. She lifted it at last, as
we came close to the dock, and I met Ellen
Winthrop&#8217;s affectionate, welcoming glance.
Her eyes swam in unshed tears, and mine
were so wet I could see only dimly that her
beautiful hair was a shade whiter, her face
paler and thinner, that she had aged mysteriously
in a month, and the hand that was
holding the parasol trembled like a leaf. She
had been very ill; there was no doubt of that.
She had been ordered a voyage, and I felt
that she had chosen this one because she
knew Clive&#8217;s wish. That meant she was willing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
to welcome me into the heart of the
family; perhaps even that she wished to help
me fit myself to take her own unique place
in her brother&#8217;s life. Oh, what joy to feel that
I could not only take freely all that my
chief wanted to give me, but that I could
be of real service to her!</p>
<p>Down the precipitous landing-steps we
went, Dolly, as usual, well in the front. Clive
and Duke were at the foot awaiting us, and,
as we felt a sense of safety in the midst of
strangers, Dolly flung herself at once into
Duke&#8217;s arms, while all the male watchers on
deck or dock gazed at him with envy. Finding
myself unobserved in this spectacular
tableau, I could give Clive my own greeting
as my heart dictated, while I told him that
his sister&#8217;s presence answered my last doubt.</p>
<p>When Dolly withdrew from the embrace
of her adoring swain&mdash;rosy, joyous, unabashed&mdash;she
adjusted her hat from its
perilous position on one side of her head,
and gazed upon Clive and me with unflattering
astonishment mixed with awe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You, too, perfidious Charlotte! You
needn&#8217;t deny it; I saw you both&mdash;just
finishing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Miss Valentine,&#8221; laughed
Clive, putting out his hand to shake hers.
&#8220;We were, in fact, only just beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think I never suspected, when
I might have known that you are the only
man in the world learned enough and good
enough for Charlotte.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were too absorbed in your own
affairs to think about mine, missy,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Now, will you be modest and grateful for
the rest of your life, since you see that my
Mr. Winthrop has brought your young man
to St. Thomas in a discreet manner that
you never could have achieved by yourself?
Take me to your sister, Clive; I want her to
know without a moment&#8217;s delay how I appreciate
her coming with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has been terribly ill, Charlotte. For
ten days after you left it was almost hopeless,
but at length she rallied, and since the
doctor insisted on a change of climate her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
whole heart was bent on coming here. She
has long suspected our feeling for each other,
and you will be such a joy to her as well as
to me, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me so happy, so happy!&#8221; I
faltered, my eyes swimming with tears. &#8220;I
was so unwilling to take all and give so little&mdash;now
it will be more!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go off by yourselves,&#8221; said Dolly.
&#8220;Be dignified and indifferent, like us. Take
Mr. Winthrop&#8217;s arm and I&#8217;ll take Duke&#8217;s.&#8221;
(Here she suited the action to the word.)
&#8220;There&#8217;s the Governor, expecting us to
luncheon and not knowing us by sight. He
won&#8217;t suspect what has happened; but after
saluting him and asking him to put some
more plates on the table, we&#8217;ll all walk up
to Miss Winthrop&#8217;s chair, and you and I will
say: &#8216;Good-morning, dear lady. Let us introduce
to you &#8220;our new possessions,&#8221; our spoils
of travel, our souvenirs of a sea-voyage.&#8217;
Then Duke and Mr. Winthrop will make a
profound obeisance, and all will be over.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it turned out! Everybody laughed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
and chatted; Dorothea kissed Ellen Winthrop&#8217;s
hand prettily, coquetted with Clive,
and began to lay siege to the nurse&#8217;s heart,
while she riveted the chains by which she
held Marmaduke Hogg in bondage. She
was in high spirits, but she was distinctly
nervous, and whenever she introduced her
fiancé to one of her fellow voyagers she
showed a heightened color as she slid quickly
over his surname.</p>
<p>Presently Clive withdrew a little distance
to talk with the Governor&#8217;s secretary, and
Dorothea caught the captain on his way
from the ship and entangled him in a
merry conversation with Miss Winthrop.
This gave Marmaduke an opportunity to
take me aside. I suspected that he wanted
to confide in me that Mrs. Valentine had
made one last determined refusal to receive
him as a son-in-law, and that after the next
few days of sea-voyaging we should meet an
irate parent at the landing in New York and
that there would be metaphorical &#8220;wigs on
the green.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>I confess in that moment, as I envisaged
the recalcitrant Dolly locked in her room
and fed upon bread and water, that I wished
Mr. Marmaduke Hogg had remained in
Washington, which is the scene of so many
battles that one more or less would not be
obvious on the horizon. On the contrary, his
first words were a surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Clifford,&#8221; he said, &#8220;no one knows
what Dolly and I owe to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what have I done?&#8221; I inquired
laughingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a thousand things! Taken my part
gently and kindly with Mrs. Valentine; and
above all, allowed Dolly to come on this
journey with you, when she was so utterly
confused by her mother&#8217;s objections to our
marriage that she did not know which way
to turn.&mdash;It&#8217;s rather a big job for a girl to
decide whether she&#8217;ll break her mother&#8217;s
heart, or her lover&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Valentine has no heart, save in the
physiological sense,&#8221; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have cut the Gordian knot,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
continued Marmaduke. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want Dolly
to know just at first, but I have set plans
in motion for changing my name back to
Forrest!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you lose six thousand dollars a year!&#8221;
I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter. I am offered a New
York partnership when the war is over and
it won&#8217;t be very long before I make it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about your dear old uncle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That hurts me, I confess. But I think if
departed spirits know nothing of our doings,
it doesn&#8217;t matter, and if they know everything,
uncle must have kept an eye on Mrs.
Valentine and will understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of leaving the whole
matter to &#8216;uncle,&#8217;&#8221; I observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not shifting the responsibility; I&#8217;m
simply counting on him. I always counted
on him and he always trusted me. If I could
get him on a spiritual long-distance telephone,
he would see that I cannot part an
only daughter from her only mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve often thought only children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
were a mistake; they bulk too heavily in the
foreground. Where there are six, each one
cannot take up so much room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. You see we&#8217;ve got to go to her
mother&#8217;s to dinner every other Sunday when
our cook&#8217;s out. I&#8217;ve learned that much
about matrimony in advance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you won&#8217;t be invited!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that would be even worse. Besides,
she has given up her apartment and leased
a charming house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she think that you and Dolly are to
live with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she does she is mistaken, but to do
her justice I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s her idea at
all. However, she is all settled and awaiting
Dorothea. The house is going to be a
surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dolly will like it; the apartment didn&#8217;t
suit her taste.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A pompous butler is installed. I discovered
all this when I went to call, and
conscientiously told her I was going to St.
Thomas with the Winthrops. He is elderly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
of course, as all the middle-aged and young
butlers are in khaki; and wonderful to relate,
there is also an aged but well-preserved
footman. He dwells on the lower floor,
and communicates with the butler on the
floor above, where the drawing- and dining-rooms
are, by means of a speaking-tube.
The moment the footman approached me
with his &#8216;What name, sir?&#8217; and bawled
&#8216;MR. <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Hogg</span>!&#8217; through the tube, the butler repeating
it resonantly to the boudoir where
Mrs. Valentine was sitting; at that moment
I knew why she had taken the house.
It was for the speaking-tubes! I have never
before seen a small house in Washington
with these annunciators. The butler and
footman were engaged for the same purpose,
that of bawling &#8216;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Mr. Hogg</span>&#8217; whenever I
called upon Dolly. After my interview with
Mrs. Valentine, which was placid, for she
thanked me coldly for telling her of my proposed
journey and said she should go herself,
but imagined that the steamers were
small and uncomfortable, and the food villainous;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
however, we would talk the whole
matter over in New York and come to some
decision; she then went to the speaking-tube
and called, &#8216;Brown! Ask Jenkins to
show Mr. Hogg out, please!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I left the lady and went at once to Clive
Winthrop for advice and began the process
of amputating my surname. Perhaps I shall
not call at the X Street house till the wedding
is over, and when the footman asks:
&#8216;What name, sir?&#8217; I shall say: &#8216;My bachelor
name, as you may remember, was Hogg, but
I am now married and it is Forrest!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The door has just closed behind one of the
most eminent physicians in the State, and
I am no longer Philippa Armstrong, but a
case of neurasthenia, an inmate of Room
Number 17, which has a yellow placard
over its entrance; a placard announcing that
no callers are allowed within, save with the
special permission of Dr. Levi Stanwood.
At present the placard is the only thing I
enjoy about the institution; that, at least,
promises peace; at all events, such peace as
can be found outside of one&#8217;s own soul.</p>
<p>I am counseled to have complete rest,
cheerful surroundings, abstinence from newspapers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
and letters, sound sleep, careful and
nourishing diet, freedom from anxiety, gentle
tonics, with electrical and other treatments
underlined upon a printed list.</p>
<p>The head physician (who is a genius in
the way of diagnosis, seeing through the
human system as if it were plate glass) has
made a careful study of my symptoms and
written my Cousin Sarah that all I need is
six or eight weeks of his care to be quite
myself again.</p>
<p>How little they understand us women,
after all&mdash;poor, blind, unsuspicious doctors!
My heart-beats, my color, my temperature,
my pulse, my blood pressure, even my
tongue, all these have told no tales to the
scientific eye, and as it was literally impossible
for Dr. Stanwood to discern my
malady, it was equally beyond him to suggest
a remedy. As a matter of fact, all I need
to make and keep me well is large and
constant doses of Richard Morton, Esq., of
Baltimore; but who would confess that to
a doctor?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>Cousin Sarah does not suspect the state
of things, the gentleman himself is, I trust,
quite ignorant, and the doctor will waste
upon me all the wealth of curative agencies
at his command without effecting the least
change in my condition.</p>
<p>Richard Morton is an orphan; so am I.
He is young, strong, good-looking, clever,
and poor. I am the first, second, and fifth; as
to one&#8217;s own beauty and cleverness it is difficult
to speak impartially.</p>
<p>I have thought for nearly six months, and
indeed I am still inclined to think, that Richard
Morton loves me, and I was equally certain,
until a few weeks ago, that he was only
awaiting a suitable opportunity to declare his
love and ask me to marry him. I had made
up my mind, whenever he should put the
important question, to answer him frankly
and joyously in the affirmative; not because
he is the handsomest or most brilliant or
most desirable person in the world, but because
for sheer lovableness and husbandliness
he is unsurpassed and unsurpassable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>In March Cousin Sarah made a visit to
Germantown and met there a Mrs. Taunton,
Richard Morton&#8217;s widowed aunt. When the
intimacy had progressed sufficiently Mrs.
Taunton told Cousin Sarah one day that she
hoped her nephew would eventually marry a
certain Amy Darling, a near neighbor of hers;
that Miss Darling&#8217;s father and Richard&#8217;s had
been friends from boyhood; and that they had
always planned a marriage between the two
young people, each an only child.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Darling, who died only this
winter, did not indulge in any such melodramatic
or bookish nonsense as setting down
commands or desires in his will, nor were any
of his bequests dependent upon them. He did
talk with his daughter, however, during his
last illness, and he did leave Richard Morton
a letter expressing his regard and confidence,
and saying that as his daughter was entirely
without relatives he should have felt much
happier had he seen her married before his
death. If he had stopped there all would have
been well, but he went on. He knew, he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
that Amy was one of the sweetest and most
attractive girls in the world, and if a mutual
affection should grow out of her acquaintance
with Richard he would be glad to know that
the fortune he had made by his own energy
might be a basis for the future prosperity
and business success of his old friend&#8217;s
son.</p>
<p>Cousin Sarah came home from Germantown
quite excited by this romance and
discussed it with me daily, in exasperating
unconsciousness that I could feel the least
distaste for the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems almost providential, Philippa,&#8221;
she said, over her knitting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providential for which of them?&#8221; I
asked, stabbing my sheet of music paper
with the pen, while I tried in vain to think
how many eighth notes would fill a measure.</p>
<p>&#8220;For both; though I was really thinking of
Mr. Morton. His business is one that peculiarly
requires capital; then again he has
many interests in Philadelphia, and there is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
that beautiful place in Germantown with
house, stable, horses, and gardens all ready
for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the girl, too; don&#8217;t forget her,&#8221; I
responded. &#8220;Though some men don&#8217;t care
for these ready-to-wear wives; they prefer
to look about and to choose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would have to look a long distance before
he found any one to compare with Miss
Darling, either in beauty or suitableness,&#8221;
said Cousin Sarah, thereby injecting the first
drop of poison in my blood and starting me
on the downward path toward nervous prostration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Darling is a man&#8217;s woman,&#8221; she
continued, unconsciously giving me another
push; &#8220;the type with which neither you nor
I have anything in common, but which we
know to be irresistible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Cousin Sarah is fifty-five, thin, angular,
erect, uncompromising. I love and respect
her, but do not care to be lumped with
her in affairs of the heart, at least not for
thirty years to come; and although I think it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
is disgusting to be labeled a &#8220;man&#8217;s woman&#8221;
it is insufferable to be told that one is <i>not</i>!</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see Amy Darling in my mind&#8217;s eye,&#8221;
I ventured; &#8220;blonde, dimply, fluffy as to
head, willowy as to figure so as to cling the
better, blue eyes swimming in unshed tears,
and a manner so exquisitely feminine that
she makes all the other women in her vicinity
appear independent and mannish. But
not all men care for pets, Cousin Sarah&mdash;some
of them prefer companions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A pet <i>is</i> a companion,&#8221; remarked Cousin
Sarah casually as she left the room, giving me
thereby an entirely new and most unpleasant
thought.</p>
<p>I have known Richard Morton for many
months, and although I have met him very
often at other places, he has been a constant
visitor at our house. If he has had any resemblance
to a possible suitor why hasn&#8217;t Cousin
Sarah discovered it? Is <i>she</i> deaf and blind, or
have my ears and eyes played me false? Am I
so undesirable that it would never cross her
mind that a man might fall in love with me?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
Hardly, for she is well aware that several men
have expressed their willingness to annex my
poverty-stricken charms.</p>
<p>As I look back upon the weeks that followed
the interview with Cousin Sarah I see
that Richard was never the same after he
received Mr. Darling&#8217;s letter. I felt a nameless
difference. It was not only that I saw
him less frequently, but that he gave me less
of himself when I did see him. I, too, was on
guard and never succeeded in being quite
natural. I am not so foolish as to give up to
another girl a man who loves me, simply because
she is rich. The thought that worries
me night and day is this: if at the moment he
only feels for me friendship, ought I to let it
grow into love when there is another woman
who could give him with herself everything
he needs to assure his career? With Philippa
Armstrong for a wife he will have to work unceasingly,
and unless fortune is particularly
kind he may not achieve a large success for
many years. If he marries Amy Darling (soft,
silly, spineless little name!) he has house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
lands, and money, all the influence of her
father&#8217;s former business associates, and has,
besides, carried out his own father&#8217;s wishes.</p>
<p>This is considerable; quite enough to make
a man reflect and vacillate, unless he is so
deeply in love already that no temptation is
strong enough to assail him.</p>
<p>Richard Morton, I know, likes to dance
with me, sing with me, golf with me, talk
with me, consult with me about his affairs,
write letters to me; and more than that, he
doesn&#8217;t like to have other men usurp these
privileges; but I am not prepared to say
that he would pine away if circumstances
removed me altogether from his path. At any
rate, these perplexities have been too much
for my peace of mind, and when Richard
Morton announced that he had business
which would keep him in Philadelphia for a
month I began to feel physically ill and unable
to bear Cousin Sarah&#8217;s sympathy, her
curiosity, even at last her proximity. When
the doctor advised my coming here to this
quiet, restful place I eagerly embraced the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
opportunity simply because I could be alone,
and because I need not meet Richard until he
had enjoyed a full month of Amy Darling&#8217;s
society, either succumbing to its fascination
or resisting it, as the case might be.</p>
<p>Would it be nobler of me to give him up
before he is really mine, knowing that in this
way I am advancing his worldly interests?
This is the question that I hope solitude
will help me to answer, but its complications
and side-issues are so many that I feel dazed
by their number and their difficulty. I went
to sleep last night echoing the old negro&#8217;s
prayer: &#8220;Thou knowest what&#8217;s about right,
Lord. Now do it!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Thursday</i></p>
</div>

<p>I was allowed to sit on my balcony for an
hour this morning. This would have been a
pleasant change had I not heartily disliked at
first sight my next-door neighbor who was
sitting on the adjoining balcony. At noon she
sent me a bunch of pansies and her card:
Mrs. Grosvenor Chittenden-Ffollette.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>Among fifty or sixty attendants there are
always a few who gossip in spite of repeated
warnings from the authorities. Sometimes it is
a young nurse, sometimes a masseuse, a manicure
or a shampooer, but there are always
those who retail the news, mostly innocent
news, of an institution like this. Cold-packing,
or rubbing, or spraying, or electrifying, or
brushing, or polishing&mdash;all these operations
open the flood-gates of speech and no damming
process is effectual. Miss Ph&oelig;be Blossom
is the herald who proclaims tidings of
various kinds in my room, and there is also a
neophyte in the electricity department who
is always full of information and quite unable
to retain it. It would be almost more than human
to ask them to be silent when they are
the only links with the world outside. A system
reduced to nothingness by a supper of
Wheatoata Coffee, Cracker-dust Croquettes,
Cosmos with milk, and a choice of Cerealina,
Nuttetta, Proteinetta, or Glucosa is in no
fit state to resist gossip.</p>
<p>It seems that Mrs. Chittenden-Ffollette
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
is more than a mere woman&mdash;she is a remarkable
&#8220;case,&#8221; and has proved a worldwide
advertisement for this sanitarium. Dr.
Stanwood has almost effected a cure; her disease
has had to be named and her symptoms
have been written up in all the medical journals.
I don&#8217;t know what sort of person she
was before she became a case, but she is now
a greater tyrant than Caligula or Catherine
of Russia. As to her disease, she has those
things that she ought not to have, and she
has not those things that she ought to have,
and there is no health in her; or at least there
was not until she came here a year ago. Now
she is strong enough to perambulate in the
corridor a little while each morning or be
wheeled along the board-walk in the afternoon,
and when she hears that some of the
other patients are suffering, she sneers at
their modest, uninteresting ailments and
glances in at their doors with half-disguised
contempt. You know the expression of the
prize dog who is borne from the show hung
with medals and ribbons&mdash;how he gazes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
on the little mongrel curs that gather with
the crowd in the streets?</p>
<p>Her name, Chittenden-Ffollette, is of as
vital importance as her medical-journal malady.
When the third floor is in dire confusion;
when Mrs. Parks has hysterics and Miss
Simmons is crying for her mother, and Mrs.
Bell&#8217;s hot-water bottle has burst in the bed,
and Miss Phipps has discovered that the undergraduate
has bandaged the wrong ankle,
Miss Blossom sometimes becomes flustered
and hurried and calls her patient Mrs. Follett,
whereupon she says, &#8220;<i>Chittenden</i>-Ffoll<i>ette,
if</i> you please!&#8221;</p>
<p>If by any chance she sees the Chittenden-Ffollette
without the hyphen in the Nurses&#8217;
Bedside Record Book or scribbled on the
morning paper she doesn&#8217;t need any stimulant
the rest of the day. The omission of the
hyphen sends up her pulse and temperature
to the required point for several hours,
though there is always a reaction afterward.
I&#8217;ve told Dr. Levi that I should name one
of her complaints hyphenitis. The occasional
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
operation performed on the hyphen by Miss
Blossom, or the young lady at the stationery
counter, might be called hyphenotomy.
Everybody detests Mrs. Chittenden-Ffollette,
but as the banner patient of the sanitarium
she must be treated with respectful
consideration. All America&#8217;s most skillful
physicians have struggled with her organism.
They have tried to get her symptoms into
line, so to speak, so as to deduce some theory
from the grand array of phenomena, but
the symptoms courteously decline to point
in any one direction. When the doctors get
seven eighths of them in satisfactory relation
there are always two or three that stay out
and sulk, refusing to collaborate in any sort of
harmony. They act precisely like an obstinate
jury, in that they calmly refuse to agree,
and then Mrs. Chittenden-Ffollette appeals
to a higher court where flaws in the testimony
are always found, judgment is reversed,
and a new trial ordered. The greatest surgeons
in Europe have left the bedsides of
crowned heads to ponder over her inscrutable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
mysteries, and have returned to their
sovereigns crushed and humbled. All this attention
would have upset a stronger character
than hers, and now that she is in a fair
way to recover, her pride will have its inevitable
fall. Though much more agreeable and
docile than when she entered, she is in uniformly
low spirits. The truth is, she liked
being an unsolved mystery and she is a good
deal nettled at being found at last both soluble
and curable&mdash;obliged to live, like an
ex-president, on the glories of the past.</p>

<p>Buckle, in his &#8220;History of Civilization,&#8221;
claims that men and women are divided into
three classes. The first and lowest talks of
persons, the second of things, and the third
and highest, of ideas. I should divide the human
race into four, instead of three classes,
and name as the lowest those persons who
discuss their symptoms. The patients here
are counseled not to do it, so the vice is reduced
to a minimum, being practiced, say,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
not more than three out of the fourteen waking
hours.</p>
<p>Swinging in a hammock in a shady nook
this afternoon the conversation that floated
to me under my distant tree was somewhat
after this fashion.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. A.</i> &#8220;Once I had neurasthenia. For
three months I couldn&#8217;t be moved in bed,
and for nine weeks I couldn&#8217;t turn my head
on the pillow.&#8221;</p>
<div class='la'>
<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> } &#8220;Mercy!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> } &#8220;Oh, Mrs. A.!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. D.</i> } &#8220;Good gracious!&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> &#8220;Cerebro-spinal meningitis is
worse than neurasthenia. I had it four years
ago, and the doctor said he&#8217;d never seen a
woman live that was as ill as I was. One
night my temperature was 167.&#8221;</p>
<div class='la'>
<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> } &#8220;Goodness!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> } &#8220;That&#8217;s pretty high!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. A.</i> } &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m perfectly sure, or at
least I think I am; I am seldom wrong on figures.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p><i>Mrs. A.</i> &#8220;I asked, because I&#8217;ve noticed
here that the thermometers register only 110,
and I wondered how they measured the temperature
when it rose above that point.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. E. (huffily).</i> &#8220;Probably they have
extra long thermometers for extreme cases.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. F.</i> &#8220;I am glad that in this sanitarium
they take the temperature by tucking the
barometer-thing under the arm. My doctor
at home always puts it under the tongue, and
it is a perfect nuisance. He never gets it well
placed but that I think of something I want
to say. Then, of course, I have to keep still
for three minutes, which seem three hundred,
and by that time I have either forgotten it or
changed my mind, so there I am!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &#8220;Just after my youngest child was
three years old&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. F. (interrupting).</i> &#8220;I was going to say,
when Mrs. E. spoke about the barometer,
that after I was engaged to Mr. F. I had a
dreadful attack of brain fever. I was ill in bed
three months and they couldn&#8217;t touch a
brush to my hair for nine days.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. G. (bravely).</i> &#8220;Just after my youngest
child was three&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. X.</i> &#8220;A man patient was brought on
to our floor this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> &#8220;<i>Our</i> floor? I wish they <i>would</i> have
separate corridors for male patients.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. X.</i> &#8220;This gentleman is an old friend
of Dr. Levi&#8217;s. His wife has been here four
weeks, and now he&#8217;s been taken ill, so they&#8217;ve
put him next her on the first floor.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I hate to have him
near us.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> &#8220;Why? He&#8217;s perfectly harmless;
he is too ill to move.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I wish he could! Anything
to relieve this hideous dullness. What&#8217;s
the matter with him, I wonder!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. D.</i> &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask Miss Oaks when I have
my hot fomentations this afternoon; she
knows everything and she&#8217;s as generous as a
prince with her knowledge.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p><i>Mrs. G. (patiently).</i> &#8220;Just after my youngest
child was&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A nurse passes through the grove, bearing
a sterilized tray with peptonized preparations
on it.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Y. (calling her).</i> &#8220;Nurse! what&#8217;s the
matter with the new man-patient on our
floor?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Nurse (discreetly).</i> &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Mrs. Y.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. X. (as the nurse vanishes).</i> &#8220;She does,
but she&#8217;s a stiff thing! Anyway, I heard the
attendants whispering about him in the corridor
before breakfast. Something&mdash;I think
it&#8217;s an organ&mdash;is floating about in him.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>All.</i> &#8220;<i>Floating?</i> What kind of an organ?
Horrors!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. X.</i> &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t understand exactly.
You know people always roar if they have
nothing particular to say, but if it is interesting
they whisper. I distinctly heard the
word &#8216;<i>floating</i>.&#8217; I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s one
of his regular organs, or something he swallowed
accidentally.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. C. (plaintively).</i> &#8220;Doctors are never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
satisfied. If anything floats they want to get
it stationary, and if it&#8217;s stationary they want
to cut it loose.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. G.</i> &#8220;<i>Just after my youngest child</i>&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> &#8220;They say Mrs. H. is going to
leave to-morrow; she doesn&#8217;t like the food or
the service.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> &#8220;Goodness, she has all the service
there is on our floor! Nobody else gets
a chance! She spends her whole silent hour
pushing the electric button.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. D.</i> &#8220;Yes, Miss Oaks declares she
&#8216;lays&#8217; on it. She says that the head nurse
told Mrs. H. she must ring less frequently,
or the bell would be removed. Miss Oaks says
the patients that pay the smallest rates always
ring the bells most. It isn&#8217;t fair that a
thirty-dollar patient should annoy a whole
row of eighty-dollar ones and prevent their
bells from being answered.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. X.</i> &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing made out of
Mrs. H. at thirty dollars a week. She was as
contented as possible last night, but this
morning she wanted her bed in the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
corner, awnings put on the windows, and the
bureau changed for a chiffonier. Come, we
must all go in for treatment&mdash;it wants five
minutes of four.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. G., in despair, as she sees the occupants
of the hammocks dispersing, almost
shrieks: &#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Just after my youngest</span>&mdash;&#8221;</p>

youngest, and she is obliged to seek another

<p><i>Saturday</i></p>
</div>

<p>The doctor found me &#8220;over-treated&#8221; this
morning and advised a day of quiet, with a
couple of hours on the roof-garden or under
the trees.</p>
<p>I have heard at various times sighs of weariness
or discontent or pain issuing from the
room opposite mine, and this afternoon when
Miss Blossom had gone into Number 19 to sit
with the haughty Mrs. Chittenden-Ffollette
I stole across the corridor and glanced in at
the half-open door of Number 18.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>The quaintest girl raised herself from a
mound of sofa-pillows and exclaimed: &#8220;Why,
you beautiful thing! Are you Number 17?
I didn&#8217;t know you looked like that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very kind of you,&#8221; I answered,
blushing at this outspoken greeting; &#8220;but I
am not beautiful in the least; it is because
you do not expect much from a person who
has just crept out of bed. I don&#8217;t look any
better when I am dressed for a party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now get
on my bed and cuddle under the afghan and
we&#8217;ll talk till Miss Blossom comes back.
Won&#8217;t she beat you for being out of your
room? Why are you here? You haven&#8217;t the
least resemblance to a rest cure! What is the
matter with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Backache, sideache, shoulderache, headache,
sensation of handcuffs on wrists, balls
and chains on ankles, lack of appetite, and
insomnia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all? Haven&#8217;t you any disease?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe not,&#8221; I answered humbly, &#8220;but
the effect is the same as if I had. Why are you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
here?&#8221; I asked in return, as I looked admiringly
at her shining brown hair, plump, rosy
cheeks, and dancing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came here, so to speak, in response to
an ideal; not my ideal&mdash;I never have any&mdash;but
Laura Simonds&#8217;s. She is my dearest
friend and one of the noblest girls you ever
knew. She said the separation from the world
would do us both good, and so it might if she
could have stayed to keep me company. Now
she has the world and I have the separation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t here, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, worse luck! She is always working
and planning for the good of others, but she
is constantly meeting with ingratitude and
misunderstanding. She had just brought me
here when she was telegraphed for to turn
about and go home. You see she had sent two
ailing slum children to be taken care of at her
house, and it proved to be scarlet fever,
and, of course, her stepmother took it the
first thing&mdash;she&#8217;s a hateful person and takes
everything she can get&mdash;and then the cook
followed suit. Now they blame Laura and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
she has to find trained nurses and settle
everything before she comes back to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re not an invalid? I thought
you were in pain and couldn&#8217;t reach the bell.
That&#8217;s the reason I looked in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, no, I was only yawning! I came
for what Laura calls the healing influence of
solitude, but Laura thought as the place was
so expensive, and treatment was included,
we&#8217;d better take Turkish baths, massage,
and electricity, they&#8217;re so good for the complexion.
I have a little table to myself in
the convalescents&#8217; dining-room and haven&#8217;t
made any acquaintances. I can&#8217;t stand their
sweetbread complexions and their double
chins. The patients are all so fat they might
sing Isaac Watts&#8217; hymn in unison: &#8216;Much of
my time has run to waist.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not an inspiring assemblage,&#8221; I
agreed, &#8220;though I haven&#8217;t seen them all
together, as you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they think of nothing but themselves,
which is exactly what I want to think
about&mdash;myself, I mean. There&#8217;s one charming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
girl on this floor. Something&#8217;s the matter
with her solar plexus and they won&#8217;t allow
her to talk, so we have had some nice conversations
in the silent hour. They&#8217;ve told
me now I mustn&#8217;t call again; it seems that I
was too exciting. Tell me something about
yourself, Vashti&mdash;I am sure that&#8217;s your
name, or Semiramis or Zenobia or Judith,
and if it isn&#8217;t one or another of those I don&#8217;t
want to hear what it is, for you wouldn&#8217;t
look like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just here a page brought in a letter which
she glanced through with an &#8220;Excuse me,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Now Laura can&#8217;t come to-morrow!
She is certainly the most unfortunate
being in the universe. She became very much
interested in a deaf man that she met in her
settlement work, and so as to give the poor
thing employment she appointed him Superintendent
of the Working Boys&#8217; Club. Now
the working boys refuse to play with him and
the directors have had a meeting asking
Laura to remove him at once. I do think they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
might have endured him one season when
I gave him a twenty-dollar ear-trumpet,
but some people are utterly unreasonable;
and here I am, in need of advice every moment,
and Laura kept in the city!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a soul; have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one but a cousin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe nobody nice and interesting
has a family nowadays. Laura has no one
but an uncongenial stepmother, and that
is the reason we are so intimate. I am so
giddy and frivolous, and Laura is so noble
and self-sacrificing that I try to form myself
on her now and then, when I&#8217;m not too
busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You live with her, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! I don&#8217;t live anywhere in particular.
Of course I have a house and a lady
housekeeper, but she doesn&#8217;t count. I&#8217;ve
been staying mostly with a Mrs. Beckett, an
old friend of my mother&#8217;s. She is the dearest
and loveliest woman in the world and I can&#8217;t
bear to be away from her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t she join forces with you if you
are so alone in the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because there&#8217;s a son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he too young, or too old, to join
forces?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s just right, and he&#8217;d be only too
glad to join forces, or anything else that had
me in it, but he mustn&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s the reason
Laura made me come here!&#8221; And with
this she punched the sofa-pillows rebelliously,
looking more like an enraged Angora kitten
than anything else.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your hour for cold spray,&#8221; said Jimmy,
the page-boy, peeping in at the crack of
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come!&#8221; she responded unwillingly.
&#8220;Now do steal in again,&#8221; she whispered,
turning to me, &#8220;for I must talk to somebody,
and if Laura could see you I know she would
think you safer than anybody here.&#8221;</p>
<p>That afternoon, as I swung in my hammock
in the grove below the sanitarium, I
looked up at its three stories of height and
its rows upon rows of windows, and wondered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
how many cases of neurasthenia under its roof
were traceable to a conflict between love and
conscience. &#8220;I begin to have an interest in
that chatterbox neighbor of mine,&#8221; I thought
drowsily, &#8220;and that, after vowing not to make
an acquaintance in this place. Love will be a
side dish, not the roast, in her bill of fare, if
I am any judge of character, and why does
her Laura attempt to stem the natural tide
of events? It is almost wicked of the Fates
to give such a featherhead any problems to
solve; she ought to have her what&#8217;s-his-name,
Beckett, if she wants him, particularly if he
wants her. As for the noble Laura, I long to
make her acquaintance. I can almost hear
the uncongenial stepmother, the feverish
cook, and the infuriated directors, clamoring
for a providence to remove her from their
field of vision, and substitute some thoroughly
practical and ignoble person in her
stead.&#8221;</p>

<div class='ra'>
<p><i>Sunday</i></p>
</div>

<p>I was very happy all the morning; so happy
that I forgot my tonics, massage, and sedative
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
tablets; but the doctor called at noon
and spoke of the wonderful way in which my
system responded to his remedies, so I said
nothing.</p>
<p>Cousin Sarah forwarded me a letter from
Richard Morton, who is superintending some
surveying near a small town in Pennsylvania.
He knows that I am not well and away from
home on a visit to the country, but, of course,
he is not aware of my exact whereabouts. It
was just one of his gay, friendly letters, with
an undertone of something warmer in it.
Among other things he said:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>How weak a thing is man! Now that you are so
far away and I am exiled in a village where there
is but one post a day I suffer pangs of hunger for
a word from you. So far the one daily mail would
have been all too ample for your desires, since
you have not written a word as yet; but there is
always the hope! I have been speculating to-night
upon the frightful risks and dangers surrounding
the man who is waiting for a letter. It seems to
me the very best postal service is inadequate to
take care of a letter from you to me! Think of the
uncertainties and perils to which it is exposed in
.pm +1
transit! You give it to a maid to drop in a pillar
post-box, but she may forget and leave it in her
pocket, or she may lose it. Or say she drops it in;
it must be removed from the box by an ordinary
human being who has no conception of the issues
involved in the rigid performance of this particular
duty. The letter is then taken to the branch
office of your section, then to the general post, and
then to the railway, where new dangers menace
its precious existence. The train may be robbed;
and if a single letter is stolen it will be yours to
me. No man alive could resist a letter of yours
after he had once read one.</p>
</div>
<p>Is there not a note of tenderness here, a
note that has crept in only during the last
few months? But what if there is? It occurred
to me after dinner that the question of his
feeling for me is not the only, nor even the
principal one to be considered. The point
under advisement is, shall I allow him to love
me when there is something better in store
for him?</p>
<p>Miss Blossom had scarcely left my room
this evening when I heard a pattering step
and a hurried tap on my door. On my saying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
&#8220;Come,&#8221; my opposite neighbor slipped in
and turned the key in the lock. It was an
unconventional and amusing performance,
but I didn&#8217;t mind. Somehow one couldn&#8217;t
mind anything with such a spoiled baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening, Zuleika!&#8221; she said. &#8220;No,
you needn&#8217;t smile and raise your finger at me
as if you were dying to tell me your name is
Abigail! Miss Blossom has gone for the night,
hasn&#8217;t she? I thought so. You know it&#8217;s the
nurses&#8217; ball this evening, and there&#8217;s only
one attendant on duty in each corridor from
now to half-past nine. May I have this big
chair by the window? I am so bored with this
place that it excites me even to think how
stupid it is. I almost wish I had a symptom
or two, just by way of sensation. Did you
have Somnolina for supper? I did, and some
time I shall make a scene in the dining-room
when I watch the hundred and fifty dyspeptics
simultaneously lifting cups of Teaette
or Somnolina to their parched lips.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be ashamed,&#8221; I chided,
&#8220;when you know almost every one who is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
here needs to be put upon a diet. You wouldn&#8217;t
expect champagne, terrapin, and canvasback
ducks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it; don&#8217;t scold, it makes you look
like Cassandra. Isn&#8217;t the moonlight enchanting,
and if this weren&#8217;t a health resort
wouldn&#8217;t it be a heaven upon earth?&#8221;</p>
<p>The broad, unscreened windows were wide
open and vines of woodbine or honeysuckle
framed them on every side. A lake shone like
a silver mirror in the distant landscape and
the elms and maples and chestnuts swayed
in the summer breeze. Little groups chatted
on the broad piazzas, and here and there on
a rustic bench in the moonlight sat a man
and a woman&mdash;two minds with but a single
thought, and that thought his or her own solar
plexus.</p>
<p>It was an hour for confidences, and I remember
that my troubled heart cried out
for a strong, tried friendship on which to
draw for counsel and sympathy. What wonder,
then, that the Angora kitten, deprived
of her Laura, emptied her silky little head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
of some of its worries, divining that I was
older and graver and perhaps would find her
lost ball and give it to her to play with
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no telling when Laura will be
here!&#8221; she exclaimed despairingly. &#8220;When
there is any duty within a thousand miles she
stays to perform it. Mrs. Beckett has poisoned
herself with mercury and Laura thinks she
ought to go and nurse her for a day or two&mdash;as
if Mrs. Beckett hadn&#8217;t six maids and
twenty thousand a year to spend in nurses!
Laura can&#8217;t bear Tom, his incurable levity
gets on her nerves, and why she wants to martyr
herself by staying in the house with him
when I&#8217;d be only too glad to go, passes my
comprehension!&#8221;</p>
<p>(I can&#8217;t explain it, but at this juncture I
seemed to have visions of Laura flirting with
the Beckett during the Kitten&#8217;s absence.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; she continued, rippling
along as if natural speech had been denied
her for hours, &#8220;sometimes I wish I hadn&#8217;t
selected such a superior being for a bosom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
friend, and then again I despise myself for
harboring such a mean feeling. I&#8217;m forever
trying to climb, and Laura is continually
trying to drag me to her level, but I suppose
I don&#8217;t belong there, and that&#8217;s the reason
I keep slipping off and sliding down. At this
minute, if she&#8217;d let me be the groveling little
earthworm I am by nature, I could marry
Tom Beckett and be as happy as the day is
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; I asked sympathetically,
though rather ashamed to drop
a plummet into so shallow a brook. &#8220;If you
love his mother so dearly, and love him too,
and are sure of his affection, why don&#8217;t you
marry him? Isn&#8217;t he suitable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; he&#8217;s almost too suitable; that&#8217;s
one of the lions in the way. His family is good,
he is as handsome as Apollo, and he has a
much larger income than mine, but you see
there&#8217;s another man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another man! You didn&#8217;t mention him
yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I? How funny! But after all it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
our very first interview, and even silly I have
my reserves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you love them both equally?&#8221; I
asked, trying to keep the note of sarcasm
out of my voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not. I care nothing about anybody
but Tom Beckett, but Laura says that
such a marriage will simply mean a life of
self-indulgent luxury, idleness, and pleasure.
She says marriage is something loftier and
nobler than pleasing one&#8217;s self; that it ought
to mean growth and development both to
the man and the woman. She says that I
should have no influence on Tom, and that
I need somebody strong and serious to
steady me. She says Tom and I would only
frisk through life and leave the world no better
or wiser than we found it. She even says&#8221;
(and here she turned her face to the honeysuckles)&mdash;&#8220;I
don&#8217;t like to repeat it, but
Laura is so advanced she makes my embarrassment
seem simply idiotic&mdash;she even
says that the children of such a union would
be incurably light-minded and trivial; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
oh, Zuleika, if one isn&#8217;t a bit advanced in
any way, doesn&#8217;t it seem hard to keep from
marrying somebody you love just for the
good of a few frivolous children you&#8217;ve never
seen in your life?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was neither the place, the hour, nor the
subject for laughter, but I forgot my neurasthenia
and gave way to a burst of wholehearted
mirth! Every second of time seemed
to increase the unconscious humor of her
point of view, and only fear of the nurse on
duty in the corridor enabled me to control
myself at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I been funny?&#8221; she asked delightedly,
as she drew her head in the window.
&#8220;I never can see my own jokes, but I&#8217;m
glad to have amused you, only I did hope
for a little sympathy. Everybody can&#8217;t be
Zenobias and Vashtis and Lauras, superior
to common weaknesses!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, I do sympathize,&#8221; I said, wiping
the tears of merriment from my eyes, &#8220;and
I agree with you much more than with
Laura. Now the &#8216;other man&#8217; is, I suppose,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
all that is grave and reverend&mdash;a complete
contrast to the too trivial Thomas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and he&#8217;s as good as good can be;
trustworthy, talented, honorable, everything;
you know the kind? I never get on
with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he love you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura thinks he does, but I&#8217;ve no reason
to suppose so. We&#8217;ve always been friends,
while Tom Beckett and I squabble and make
up twice a week; but anyway, even if he
doesn&#8217;t adore me in Tom&#8217;s silly way, Laura
says I ought not to mind. She says it would
be noble of me to help him to a splendid and
prosperous career, and thinks I ought to remember
how much my father wanted him
for a son-in-law&mdash;you see he is awfully poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this coupling of fathers and poverty a
sudden light blazed in upon my consciousness
and I sat bolt upright among the sofa-pillows.
How could I have guessed that the
love-affairs of this rosy-cheeked dumpling,
the casual acquaintance of a rest-cure, could
have any connection with my own? If she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
hadn&#8217;t been the sort of person who confides
at first sight we should have learned each
other&#8217;s names at the beginning and been on
guard. The truth is, I had thought of no one
but Tom Beckett in her confessions; the personality
of &#8220;the other man&#8221; had stolen into
the chronicle so late in the day that I had
taken no interest in him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Amy Darling?&#8221; I asked her
plump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but how mean of you to pump Blossom!
I wanted to go on thinking of you as
Zuleika and have you call me something
imaginary and romantic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Philippa Armstrong. Did you ever
hear the name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but it&#8217;s all right; it looks like you,
and it&#8217;s nearly as pretty as Zenobia. Now if
Tom Beckett had only chosen you and I
could have obliged Laura by falling in love
with&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention the other man&#8217;s name!&#8221;
I cried hastily; &#8220;it just comes to me that I
may have met him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Met Dick Morton?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true then! Here was the girl whom
Richard ought, for his worldly good, to
marry, and she was not a woman at all, only
an Angora kitten, and moreover a kitten in
love with Tom Beckett!</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have met him, but I only this moment
suspected it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you known him long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles it!&#8221; she cried, leaping to her
feet excitedly. &#8220;If Dick Morton has known
you for a year he won&#8217;t want me and I can
marry Tom! Goody, goody, goody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stuff and nonsense!&#8221; I said quickly.
&#8220;Richard Morton is only a very dear
friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stuff and nonsense yourself! No man
with an eye in his head could be a dear friend
to you! And Dick Morton is the hero
sort who doesn&#8217;t care for Dottie Dimples,
but worships Vashtis and Zuleika-Zenobias.
Have you any money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a penny!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! I might have known you
wouldn&#8217;t have, with that hair and those eyes.
Never mind! I&#8217;m certain that Dick would
rather have a pauper goddess than a rich
little earthworm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t talk any more about the
matter,&#8221; I said with as much dignity as I
could muster in the midst of her laughter-provoking
nonsense, which made the most
sacred subjects seem a natural matter of
discussion. &#8220;I know through Mrs. Taunton
all about the circumstances&mdash;your father&#8217;s
wishes and his letter to Richard. If you can
possibly love him you must accept him, advance
his fortunes, and do your duty by
your father. I am determined to be as noble
as Laura Simonds in this matter and I refuse
to be a stumbling-block!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl fell limply into the lounging-chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said despondently, &#8220;if <i>you</i> are
going to be noble, too, there&#8217;s no use discussing
the matter. What an example we
shall be for the heathen nations! You will
be noble and give up Dick Morton; I shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
be noble and marry him; and be noble at
the same time in giving up Tom; Tom will be
noble in suffering me to marry anybody but
himself; Dick will be noble in obliging my
father and marrying me instead of you; Laura
is always noble! We could use up a whole
order of nobility among us! And it is all so
silly! Do you suppose my dear father would
want four of us to be unhappy, his own
daughter among them? It&#8217;s really only Laura
who matters, and if you had any ingenuity
you could pacify her and persuade her that
it is my duty for once to follow my ignoble
inclinations. I am afraid of her, but <i>you</i>
needn&#8217;t be! You could blaze and flash and
tower, if you only would, and save us all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to forget,&#8221; I urged, &#8220;that Mr.
Morton has never asked me to marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing; he has probably been
thinking how he could get me nicely disposed
of, or how he could earn a roof under which
he could ask you to step in wet weather. He&#8217;s
been too stupid and moody and dull this last
winter for any use, and now I understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
him. Has he ever seen you like this with your
Rebecca-at-the-well hair down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so; or he&#8217;d have forgotten the
necessary roof!&mdash;Come in!&mdash;Goodness!
it&#8217;s your room and I locked the door! Do excuse
me; I&#8217;ll open it. A telegram for you.&mdash;Wait
outside for an answer, Jimmy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tore open the envelope, confidently expecting
that Cousin Sarah had been struck
with paralysis; instead of which I read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='ra'>
<p><i>Archville, Pennsylvania</i>,</p>
<p><i>June</i> 16</p>
</div>

<p>Have this moment secured a large and important
contract assuring two years&#8217; lucrative work.
May I come to see you immediately? Name earliest
day.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>R. M.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>I handed the message to the Kitten, who
read it and exclaimed: &#8220;I knew he was only
waiting for the roof! You see he doesn&#8217;t
worry about <i>my</i> prospects&mdash;selfish pig!
Answer it and say Thursday&mdash;you can get
well by Thursday, can&#8217;t you?&mdash;for I want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
to send for Tom on the same day. There&#8217;s a
polo game at home on Saturday, and Tom
has a new motor car. Tell Dick the best
hotel in the town is the Brooks House. I
must wire to Laura, too. I shall say, let me
see: I shall say: &#8216;<i>You shouldn&#8217;t have left me.
I couldn&#8217;t be noble alone.</i>&#8217; That&#8217;s just ten
words. She&#8217;ll understand fast enough, and it
will pave the way for you when you explain
the situation to her. We&#8217;ll leave the sanitarium
Friday and get your Cousin Sarah to
chaperon us on the journey home. Here,
I&#8217;ve written my messages, now do yours&mdash;hurry!
There!&mdash;Jimmy, you&#8217;re too old to
play with matches, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then, you can be trusted with
these two telegrams. Don&#8217;t hold them near
the fire; there&#8217;s a match in each of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a patient Dr. Levi says I am almost
as great a credit to the institution as Mrs.
Chittenden-Ffollette herself.

<p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;I slept all day, waking only
for meals.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;The handcuffs slipped off my
wrists and the balls and chains off my ankles.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;My headache, sideache,
backache, and shoulderache disappeared.
Breakfasted with the doctor on coffee, hot
biscuits, beefsteak, and griddle cakes with
sausage.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Richard Morton came.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Dismissed as completely cured.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dimensions of this mercy are above
my thoughts,&#8221; as Cromwell wrote after the
Worcester fight.</p>
